At Antoine’s, guests in the know could venture through a  door in the ladies’ room to a secret room and exit with a coffee cup full of booze. When someone asked the lucky imbiber where they got it, the response was, “It’s a mystery to me.” Just like that, the Mystery Room got its name.

A gorgeous polished bar, circa late 1800s, runs the length of the room. While you can be assured of getting a high quality French 75 (made old school with champagne and cognac), award-winning head bartender Chris Hannah is considered one of the nation’s best. Every item of the short but eclectic menu of cocktails is an inventive winner, and with several options under $10, the bar represents a good value, even for an upscale venue. Another bonus: from 6-10 p.m., patrons can order bar bites from the famous, century-old restaurant next door. The French 75’s somewhat diminutive proportions makes it best suited for smaller numbers."

Carrollton and Jeanette, where he specializes in bringing the concept of the boucherie (or, in this case, in-house butchering, curing and cooking) to the table, with a meaty menu where boudin balls and charcuterie shine, but creative dishes from smoked scallops to hamachi sashimi with kimchi should not be overlooked."
Bourbon House (The Most Incredible King Cake-Inspired Dishes To Try Right Now),"144 Bourbon St, New Orleans, LA 70130",29.9545625,-90.0691287,"Seasonal favorite, the king cake bevvy cocktail, returns for its ninth year in a row for good reason. It’s a riff on Bourbon House’s beloved and much-lauded frozen bourbon milk punch -- and it’s probably enough to stop at that.

It then became the restaurant’s wine cellar — dark, exclusive, and separate from the main building. Until Ralph Brennan Restaurant Group took over the restaurant and unleashed a massive renovation that put the iconic spot back on the map, diners never got near the cellar. Now it houses wines plus a private dining space for up to 16 people. In terms of decor, think leather chairs, brick walls, and a cypress table amidst bottles and bottles of wine."

Chef Nathan Richard makes the dough from white mountain roll and stuffs it with crawfish and goat cheese. A slightly sweet pepper jelly cream cheese plays the part of the icing, while chili flakes, dehydrated crab fat “sugar,” and green onions stand in for the tri-colored sugars. To make it truly fit for a king (or “make it a Rex”), ask for some Cajun Caviar on top. A small (without caviar) is only going to run you $16, with a $3 upcharge for caviar.

Raffish, divey, and unapologetically nostalgic, Fritzel’s remains dear even to locals despite its heavily touristed location. This style of Dixieland jazz skews towards a more mature crowd, so those looking for edge should head elsewhere. Decent beer selection and full bar. FYI: If you’re looking to sit, a hostess will direct you. Be forewarned, the club is small and often packed and the bleacher style seating isn’t cush. Fritzel’s is most likely better suited for a round or two alone with a friend rather than an all nighter with a pack of buddies. No cover but one drink minimum per set."

Then, just walk up to the cash register and let the Radostas know what you had. They trust you. The roast beef po-boy is a popular choice, though any of the po-boys are good. Additionally, the spot has a ton of Italian-American dishes on the menu — and some of them end up on po-boys. Take, for example, the Wayne Special: Veal parm and provolone with the house-made marinara on po-boy bread. A word to the wise: Get the Wayne Special toasted, but don’t get it dressed. Lettuce, tomato, and cold bread just aren’t that good on a hot veal parm po-boy. The gumbo and the onion rings are equally excellent."

This Metairie fave is known for its dim sum, not offered on traditional carts, but made to order from the menu.  Pan fried shrimp dumplings, gelatinous chicken feet, curry squid are a few of dozens of choices offered on a menu that has pictures, which is a big help.

Given Sammy’s location across from the Gentilly Lowe’s on Elysian Fields, it’s no coincidence that the Ray Ray is beloved among tradesmen and understandably so: Where else can one find fried chicken, ham, and cheese all packed into one loaf? Much of Sammy’s success stems from owner and former butcher Sammy Schloegel’s insistence on quality meat.  Choose 6” or 10” options with most larger sandwiches coming in at under $10; a large Ray Ray will set you back $12, fried seafood $12-15."

Consider splurging on a slow sipping cocktail like a sazerac or the house special, a Vieux Carre. In addition to the bar, arrangements of posh club chairs in the spacious lounge accommodate groups, and should appease even the snootiest of relatives and friends.

While the interior’s jewel-toned Victorian vibe transports guests to late 19th century New Orleans (it’s no accident Pretty Baby was filmed there), it’s the front porch, with its views of Live Oaks and passing streetcars, that gets my vote as one of the best drinking spots in the city for an Old Fashioned. New Orleanians may still be wearing shorts come December, but should the temperature drop, drinkers can head inside for a warm Irish coffee or nice pour of Scotch and take a seat at either the classic bar or in one of the cozy booths."

Though dinner boasts an excellent choose-your-own-adventure style “tasting menu” with dishes like a divine lobster Newburg, lunch is predictably no slouch. A power lunch with the approachable sensibility of the “meat and three” plate lunch (with “meats” like crab cakes and “sides” like crawfish pasta) and at only $19.84 (the hotel opened in 1984) with the option of $2 martinis, it’s also a bargain. Of note: Limit three martinis. It’s a three martini lunch, remember? Also, the martinis are made with Plymouth or Tito’s and olives and onions marinated at the hotel."

While that story may not hold up to scrutiny, what is certain is that the “Kingfish” flew the Sazerac’s head bartender to New York to instruct northerners in the proper way to make a Ramos Gin Fizz. If Long’s stamp of approval isn’t enough reason to visit, Paul Ninas’ WPA-era murals depicting New Orleans, golden wood-panelled walls and the equally crafted drinks make the Sazerac a must-see.
