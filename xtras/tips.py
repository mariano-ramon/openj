alltips = ["45 Tchoup is a perfect stop before or after a show at Tipitina’s for those seeking a friendly environment and cheap drinks Uptown (not always easy). Fun, interesting decor, warm bartenders, and a solid selection of beer on tap make it a go-to, especially if you’re a Boston sports fan. ",
"The big poppa of New Orleans breweries has an excellent brewery tour and tasting room on the North Shore. The 30 minute tours include tastings and are offered every half hour on Wednesdays and Thursdays from 2 pm – 3 pm, Fridays from 1 pm – 3 pm, Saturdays from 10:30am – 3pm, and on Sundays from 2 – 3pm. If you really just want to drink Abita and eat some burgers, look up the Abita Brewhouse and Pub.",
"The Ace offers three worthy spots. The lobby bar is what a lobby should be: mostly bar with ample cushy seating arranged into cozy groupings perfect for visiting. Across the way, the ever-so-elegant French-inspired Josephine Estelle bar also serves up tasty bites from the restaurant. Finally, the rooftop bar’s pool beckons drinkers to doff their shoes and dip their toes. Fortunately, we can do this in New Orleans even in December. All offer top notch drinks served by a staff that just stepped out of an H&M ad.",
"Ask locals for the best deal on po-boys, and it won’t be long before someone points you towards this petite corner grocery tucked into a quiet Uptown neighborhood near Tulane University. Among the options you’ll find generous fried shrimp, fish, or roast beef and gravy po-boys all coming in at under $10. Another plus: Adams Street’s po-boys are served on perfectly crispy Dong Phuong bread. Take out only. Can get crowded at peak lunch hours.",
"Another spot that shares an outdoor space with a neighboring wine bar (the owners are brother and sister), it’s a great place for both wine and beer lovers. Feast on soft pretzels with beer and cheese fondue, Two Run Farm beef debris fries, and fried oyster sliders while taking in the game. Plus, there are TVs on the dog-friendly patio at this popular Oak Street hang-out.",
"This is Evans go-to “cornerstore.” Photos of regulars decorate the counter in this “supremely picturesque spot.” Friendly customers and a chatty clerk full of stories, including those about Nicholas Cage who was a regular for a time, add to the appeal. Evans pick? Cold beer and a roast beef po-boy. ",
"Alto is the restaurant and bar at the rooftop pool in the Ace Hotel -- and it’s open to the public. In addition to some killer frozen drinks, this gorgeous spot serves up one of the best hot dogs in town. The BNC hot dog is a hot dog with cheddar on the inside, with mustard and  Maldon salt, served on a pretzel bun. And you get to enjoy it poolside. ",
"This Italian gelateria is over a century old — plenty of time to perfect a craft. For Carnival season, the adorable spot is offering vanilla gelato studded with Caluda’s traditional king cake (one of Eater NOLA’s top king cakes this season).  ",
"This 175-year old restaurant captures the old New Orleans vibe with 14 stately dining rooms, many named for Mardi Gras krewes and dressed with photos of Mardi Gras royalty and memorabilia, including crowns and scepters of long-ago Carnival balls. Six days a week, diners take a seat for three-course Creole lunch for $20.18 (like the current year). Expect dishes like charbroiled oysters, drum amandine, and German chocolate cake. Plus, add a martini or three into the mix for a quarter a piece.  One per course, makes sense right? ",
"The Mystery Room at Antoine’s earned its name during Prohibition when the 18th Amendment prohibited the sale of alcohol, an experiment that New Orleans never took very seriously. At Antoine’s, guests in the know could venture through a  door in the ladies’ room to a secret room and exit with a coffee cup full of booze. When someone asked the lucky imbiber where they got it, the response was, “It’s a mystery to me.” Just like that, the Mystery Room got its name. Now reserved for private dining, the space seats 20-50 people and is decorated with souvenirs from famous restaurants around the world and quirky items like Groucho Marx’s beret. Plenty of other dining rooms are available for both smaller and larger parties, so be sure to check the full list of offerings on the website. ",
"Once a space that was only for men, the French 75 continues to evoke the upper crust masculinity of an intimate, upper crust English club. A gorgeous polished bar, circa late 1800s, runs the length of the room. While you can be assured of getting a high quality French 75 (made old school with champagne and cognac), award-winning head bartender Chris Hannah is considered one of the nation’s best. Every item of the short but eclectic menu of cocktails is an inventive winner, and with several options under $10, the bar represents a good value, even for an upscale venue. Another bonus: from 6-10 p.m., patrons can order bar bites from the famous, century-old restaurant next door. The French 75’s somewhat diminutive proportions makes it best suited for smaller numbers.",
"When in doubt, throw it all in the blender with ice cream. King cake-flavored ice cream and a big ol’ dollop of cheesecake filling get topped with purple, green, and gold sprinkles. The shake is frozen-to-order, flash chilled with liquid nitrogen at -321 degrees Fahrenheit. The whole thing is presented in a color-changing, Mardi Gras go-cup.",
"This is the place to go to take care of po-boy needs and boiled crawfish needs — at the same time. The Carrollton spot doubles as a seafood market with the addition of daily daiquiris and a full bar. Though the shop is known for seafood, the meat is also top-knotch. Can’t decide? Go for the peacemaker po-boy: fried Louisiana shrimp, roast beef debris, and Swiss cheese. Seating is limited, but there are picnic tables outside for use on nice days.",
"So, this is a real, traditional style king cake, but it’s a king cake filled with crickets (and topped with crickets), which is just so wacky that it landed on this list. Jayme Necaise, Director of Animal and Visitor Programs at Audubon Butterfly Garden and Insectarium, says the cricket-stuffing lends “a nice nutty flavor.” The cricket topping adds a little crunch, kind of like a Danish topped with pecans. (Tastings are included with general admission while supplies last through Mardi Gras season.)",
"This friendly neighborhood bar offers a lively local crowd, reasonably priced set ups (small bottles plus mixers), a pool table and best of all, a kitchen that stays open until the wee hours. Ya-ka-mein is a proud specialty of the house, a 32-ounce rib-sticking portion with just the right balance of soy and heat. Just remember they’re closed Monday and Tuesday. ",
"While this friendly, family-run, Tulane Avenue eatery isn’t the cheapest on the list (a large oyster po-boy will set you back $18), Avery’s po-boy menu boasts some of the most over-the-top options, including buffalo shrimp and blue cheese, the “Fire in the Hole” made with hot sausage, pepper jack, jalepeños, and the “Danimal,” a heart-stopping combo of a beef patty, hot sausage, egg, onion ring and Sriracha mayo. Lunch only: closed Sundays. ",
"Sugar and booze: so simple, so needed. One wonders why it’s taken so long. Thanks to Debbie Does Doberge founders Charlotte McGehee and Charles Mary IV (12 Mile Limit tipplers have been sampling their goods for years), the wait is over. Located in 1179‘s former digs, Bakery Bar’s location in the shadow of the Crescent City Connection may be off the beaten path for some but consider a detour. Until 3 p.m., Bakery Bar functions mostly as a serious eggs and grits brunch spot; come 5, it’s dessert and drinks that rule the roost, including key lime pie, vanilla doberge brûlée, or the ultimate chocolate three-way Grasshopper Pie Bombe. Doberge cakes available for order. ",
"This seven-layer dream combines two classic New Orleans desserts — king cake and doberge. The seven layers of cake held together by cream cheese pudding, and topped with buttercream frosting and cream cheese icing. The flavors of the cake undeniably taste like a bolder version of the king cake. Slices and whole cakes are first-come, first-served at the Bakery Bar, unless you placed an order before January 5. Either way, the bar and sweet shop is worth a visit. ",
"Chef Doug Crowell, a veteran of the Herbsaint kitchen, married a Chinese American, whose father is a New York chef. Inspired by his father-in-law, Crowell makes authentic dishes like a steamed whole local fish stuffed with lemongrass and zippy dan dan noodles. The place is airy and casual and, FYI, it’s BYO. ",
"This Bywater dive bar boasts ample seating on the outside patio, where anything from blues to burlesque holds sway. The drinks are strong and cheap and the pub grub surprisingly good.  Try the chicken sausage gumbo.",
"Decidedly more done up than the Black Penny, boothy Bar Tonique centers on cocktails and casual glam. With exposed brick walls and high ceilings, Bar Tonique evokes classic New Orleans architecture. Drinks tend to run on the pricier side but quality ingredients and skill warrant the tab. Plus, $5 drink specials help soften the blow. A selection of clever temperance drinks offers even teetotalers a bit of fun.",
"Head to this Susan Spicer classic in the Quarter for the smoked duck “PB & J, or for Saturday lunch, where three small plates will only set you back $28.",
"If the weather is nice, head to this Mid City compound for gravy fries, boiled crawfish, drink specials, and — most importantly — a big screen on the deck. A deck also connects Bayou Beer Garden to Bayou Wine Garden, so there are both plenty of wine (16 wines on tap) and beer options. Here’s the game-day menu.",
"While Bear’s offers an extensive line-up of the usual po-boy suspects, it’s roast beef that’s the stand out at this Metairie comfort food locale. House roasted and served on locally baked Leidenheimer bread, Bear’s proclaims to have the best roast beef po-boy around. You be the judge. Open every day; Sundays lunch only.",
"After building a following online, this much-accoladed former pastry chef for Lilette (and trained interior designer) opened a storefront on Baronne last year. The spare, ethereal space offers a gallery-like feel that puts the focus on the art: Biundo’s upscale, immaculate cakes, tarts, and sweets. A top choice for custom, contemporary wedding cakes as well. Tip: A visit to the beautiful space begs a bottle of Champagne from the nearby Martin’s Wine Cellar to accompany the sweets.",
"Super-stylish bakery Beth Biundo Sweets is here to make Carnival dreams come true with a multi-layered, Mardi Gras-inspired cake with purple, green, and gold wedding cake-flavored layers held together by vanilla buttercream. The thing is that it tastes as good as it looks. It’s available by the slice at the bakery, or in 6” ($34), 8” ($47), and 10” ($69) rounds by pre-order. Tip: Stop by Martin’s Wine Cellar around the corner from Beth Biundo to grab a bottle of Champagne or sparkling dessert wine to take to the bakery and enjoy with a slice.",
"This kitchen at this cool Treme spot churns out divine dishes like barbecued ribs, potato salad, mac and cheese, stuffed bell peppers, seafood stuffed potatoes, fried fish with potato salad, seafood pasta, jambalaya, smoked sausage, and chicken wings. For Super Bowl Sunday, expect the game on four big screens. As usual on Sundays, there will be free food (before the game) with things like barbecue and fried fish.",
"Blue Oak BBQ will cater the entire Thanksgiving dinner for $425 (except for dessert), which comes with all the items on the holiday catering menu and gallon sizes of all the sides. This includes a whole pecan smoked turkey, barbecued brisket, roasted garlic mac and cheese, smoked oyster and artichoke dressing, cauliflower mashed potatoes, sweet potato casserole, cranberry sauce, and giblet gravy. All items also available a la carte. Order online to make it even easier. Pick up on November 22.",
"This Metairie bar and grill, owned by former Saints quarterback Bobby Hebert, is a game day mecca. An extensive menu with loads of unhealthy food, a $50 giant burger challenge, ample booze, surround sound, and so many televisions there are even some in the bathroom. Should you choose to accept the burger challenge over the course of the Super Bowl, here’s the deal: Seven patties cooked medium-well and topped with cheddar cheese, tomatoes, onions, pickles, fried shrimp, and served with Cajun Hebert Fries. Complete the challenge and eat for free. No Sharing. ",
"Chef Nathaniel Zimet has a mini Cajun compound on the corner of N. Carrollton and Jeanette, where he specializes in bringing the concept of the boucherie (or, in this case, in-house butchering, curing and cooking) to the table, with a meaty menu where boudin balls and charcuterie shine, but creative dishes from smoked scallops to hamachi sashimi with kimchi should not be overlooked.",
"Seasonal favorite, the king cake bevvy cocktail, returns for its ninth year in a row for good reason. It’s a riff on Bourbon House’s beloved and much-lauded frozen bourbon milk punch -- and it’s probably enough to stop at that. For those who need more convincing, it’s Old New Orleans rum, orgeat, cinnamon syrup, Louisiana citrus, and housemade vanilla gelato topped off with purple, green, and gold sprinkles. It comes with its own king cake baby stir stick and tastes remarkably like its name-sake.",
"Warm, woody, and welcoming with seating inside and out, this neighborhood bakery has become a popular weekend breakfast spot. Since opening in 2012, Breads on Oak has garnered a devoted following among Carrolltonians (as well as vegan and gluten-free folks), many of whom will tell you Breads on Oak boasts the best bread in town. Owner and head baker Sean O’Mahony studied baking and pastry-making in France; the influence of European technique and craft shows through his insistence on quality organic ingredients, fruit sweeteners, and plenty of gluten-free items. Aside from hearty artisanal loaves, Breads serves up decadent sweet rolls, brioches, quiches, sandwiches and arguably, the most authentically flaky croissants in town. Decent coffee to boot, plus the bakery. Open Wednesday through Sunday. Tip: Come Sunday mornings and be treated to samples of some half dozen different breads. ",
"The Wine Room at Brennan’s lies beyond the courtyard, in a building that was once a stable at the big pink Brennan’s building that was built on 1795. It then became the restaurant’s wine cellar — dark, exclusive, and separate from the main building. Until Ralph Brennan Restaurant Group took over the restaurant and unleashed a massive renovation that put the iconic spot back on the map, diners never got near the cellar. Now it houses wines plus a private dining space for up to 16 people. In terms of decor, think leather chairs, brick walls, and a cypress table amidst bottles and bottles of wine.",
"This longtime Riverbend staple quietly continues its tradition of paying homage to Louisiana’s culinary traditions. The four-course, comfort food Réveillon menu offers plenty of choice and is a good bet for those looking to accommodate dining companions with varied tastes. Oysters or New Orleans style barbecued shrimp are available for the second course, Entree options include: duck a l’orange, seafood stuffed flounder, or a pork chop with apple cider gravy. $55 per person.",
"Known for its low ceilings, friendly bartenders, and cheap drinks, Mr. Johnny’s Brothers III Lounge, with its bright yellow exterior, stands out some on trendy Magazine Street. Thank goodness, because when its time for shooting pool and listening to a juke box playing 45s, Brothers III beats swank every time. ",
"With a classic, understated elegance, this French Quarter staple offers a moderately priced four course menu with an eye towards deep, rich flavors, including crispy oysters Bienville, brandy duck liver mousse with apricot creole mustard glaze, and a butternut squash bisque with leeks and truffle cream. End with a choice between two naughty and nice Christmas desserts: peppermint panna cotta with dark chocolate ganache or praline bread pudding with eggnog custard and bourbon sauce. $48",
"The hot dog at Bud's Broiler definitely has a cult following— the dog is actually sliced down the center and served on a hamburger bun with toppings including chili, cheese, and/or hickory BBQ sauce. The City Park location is open 24 hours, which is of vital importance for weekend warriors.",
"This Magazine Street laundro-bar has super-friendly bartenders, burgers, occasional karaoke, and a stripper pole for getting frisky while you wait for clean clothes. It’s also a popular, come-as-you-are gathering spot for locals. Open daily from 11 a.m. to 3 a.m.",
"This much loved local bar is a dive with a capital D, complete with a rib-sticking menu, live music in the back bar every night of the week, and a dog friendly scene up front. Fried green beans, red beans and rice, burgers, deli sandwiches, all just fine, although getting fancy with Alfredo might be over-reaching.  ",
"Head over to SoBou for a king cake sua da. With espresso, king-cake infused brandy, sweetened condensed milk and vanilla, this cocktail takes a cue from New Orleans’s large Vietnamese population and the iconic cafe sua da (or Vietnamese iced coffee).",
"After years of overseeing the bakery departments of several dozen Rouse’s supermarkets, owner Chaya Conrad traded the corporate model for this one-of-a-kind, bright red corner spot in the funky Bywater. The $6 breakfast options include egg scrambles or “go cups” made from different classic combinations such as egg, bacon, grits, and cheese; shrimp and grits; tofu scramble; or hot sausage, biscuit and gravy. For lunch, build-your-own salad or hearty sandwich options on house-made bread satisfy. The lagniappe you want: $5 cake slices with about half a dozen options. Bonus: Live music 11 p.m. to 1 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays. ",
"Can’t make it to the Ogden? This spunky little neighborhood bakery in the Bywater dishes Miss Linda’s famous ya-ka-mein for lunch, a $6 bowl of goodness  served every day of the week. Save room for dessert here, the chocolate doberge by the slice is swoon-worthy. ",
"This clean-as-a-whistle, bright, and airy Metairie gem aims for efficiency with its 45-minute, two-course “quick lunch” for $19. Start with a salad or a soup and follow it up with Buffalo fried chicken salad, tuna Niçoise, or a turkey club. There’s a full a la carte menu for those with more time. Plus martinis are only $5 and made with Chopin vodka, so why not just make more time?",
"Why wait on those long daytime lines at Cafe du Monde when there are tables to spare at 3 a.m.? This iconic cafe is on everybody’s list for cafe au lait and fresh, fried, sugary beignets, three to an order. An all time favorite New Orleans experience is to order takeaway beignets from Cafe du Monde and commandeer a bench facing the Mississippi. Wander that way just about any time and find folks with the same idea, clouds of powdered sugar swirling in the air like gnats on an August eve. ",
"Cane & Table’s unassuming exterior makes it easy to miss; indeed when its doors are closed, it almost looks like the place has gone out of business. But step inside and you’ll be rewarded with a spare and airy interior that draws more from the Quarter’s Latin and Caribbean connections than its European ones. A subtle navigation theme can be found on Cane & Table’s highly original cocktail menu. Most drinks combine spirits and draw from such diverse spirits as amaro, negroni, mezcal, armagnac, and tequila; a selection of sherry and ciders is also available. Seating is varied with a wrap-around bar, tables, and back patio options, though come evening, tables may be full with diners. Upper shelf and from scratch ingredients means cocktail prices tend to run high at $10-15. For those on a budget, consider the weekday happy hour specials, including nibbles, from 3-6 p.m. Committed morning drinkers may want to explore the all you can drink weekend brunch special. ",
"For a version of ya-ka-mein on the lighter side, head to this family-owned seafood shop on St. Claude in Bywater. Besides all manner of boiled seafood, order the beef or chicken for around $6, a portion floating with veggies like bok choy, carrots and bell pepper in the mix. ",
"The pisco-focus of the bar shines in a cocktail menu that transports drinkers to the wilds of Peru. The decidedly updated feel of the architecture with its spare wooden bar and black and white floor tiles is balanced by a warm, welcoming staff deft at mixing cocktails by night, and by day keeping the surrounding business district’s coffee mugs filled with quality pours. The rooftop bar is also worth a visit when open, especially for indie movie nights paired with themed drinks.",
"The smartest and very best savory king cake out there. Chef Nathan Richard makes the dough from white mountain roll and stuffs it with crawfish and goat cheese. A slightly sweet pepper jelly cream cheese plays the part of the icing, while chili flakes, dehydrated crab fat “sugar,” and green onions stand in for the tri-colored sugars. To make it truly fit for a king (or “make it a Rex”), ask for some Cajun Caviar on top. A small (without caviar) is only going to run you $16, with a $3 upcharge for caviar. Note: Orders must be placed 24 hours in advance.",
"Arnaud’s, already an especially swanky sight to behold when it’s all decked out for the holidays, is making plans for a particularly special New Year’s Eve. The new year marks 100 years since the restaurant opened, as well as the tricentennial of New Orleans. Just before midnight, guests will receive accessories to celebrate the ringing in of the new year. Plus, its James Beard Award winning bar will be slinging holiday drinks like hot buttered rum, Tom and Jerry, and Chris Hannah’s Dickens’ Toddy.",
"Central City BBQ has all the turkey needs covered with 12-14 pound, 10-hour smoked turkeys. Sides include green bean casserole, sweet corn spoon bread, sweet potato casserole, and barbecue jambalaya. The cut-off date for ordering is November 20. Pick up before 11 a.m. on Thanksgiving Day. View the full menu here. ",
"Line up at this French Quarter grocery dating back to 1906 for a taste of one of the city's signature sandwiches, the muffuletta, comprised of Italian meats, olive salad, provolone and oil on sesame bread. Take it to the river and enjoy.",
"Arguably some of the best local beer along St. Tammany Trace, it’s about five miles from both Old Rail Brewing and the Abita Brewery. The brewery is small and tours feel intimate. The owners, Josh and Jamie Erickson, keep the brewery open Thursday and Friday from 5 -- 9 pm, Saturday 11am - 9 pm, and Sunday 12 pm - 6 pm. It’s a great stop if you’re doing a cycling route along the St. Tammany Trace. Be sure to try the Old 504 vanilla and coffee-infused porter. Accessible from the Trace.",
"This dingy spot on the corner of Chartres and Bienville has regulars that date back to the 70s,  the days when the French Quarter was a real neighborhood and residents were proud to be called Quarter rats. The drinks are cheap, the bar grungy, the crowd mostly talkative. An ideal place to find solace away from the masses. ",
"This corner dive bar near Frenchman features a wide range of live music (from blues and rockabilly to metal) daily.  Plus, weirdos, laundry facilities, and drink specials make it a favorite among locals. Visit WWOZ for the full music line-up. Open 24 hours. ",
"New Orleans native and culinary icon Linda Green, aka Miss Linda the Ya-Ka-Mein Lady, creates her signature dish at festivals including Jazz Fest, Second Lines, and at the Ogden Museum of Southern Art’s After Hours program most Thursday nights 5:30-8 pm. Hers is the ya-ka-mein gold standard, so don’t miss it. ",
"Galatoire’s teams up with Chez Champagne Gosset for New Year’s Eve dinner. Founded in 1584, Gosset is the oldest wine house in Champagne.  The four-course dinner includes classics like poached sea scallops, filet mignon, and a gruyere and caramelized onion bread pudding with fondue. Open bar. Live entertainment by Anais St. John. Balcony access following dinner. 10 p.m. to 1 a.m.  Tickets are $225 per person,",
"Adventurous eaters love this Metairie hot spot for its exotic Chinese menu offerings. If bean curd skin, tripe with special sauce, and fried pork intestines aren’t your jam, crispy duck, orange beef and other traditional dishes more than suffice. Daily lunch specials are cheap and good. At $8.95 a person, the appetizer platter is a bargain, overflowing with egg rolls, wontons, fried shrimp, shrimp toast, crab ragoon, and barbecue ribs. Ask for the secret menu and get the soup dumplings.",
"Nothing fancy going on here, just a hole-in-the-wall with rock bottom prices, generous pours, and a solid jukebox. Bartenders range from smiling to sullen, but nobody seems to mind. Chuck’s always draws a crowd on game days including peeps walking to and from the Dome. ",
"So they make their burgers under a grease splattered hub cap and yes, they are good. The staff is a hoot, always talking some kind of smack, i.e. “We may not be pretty, but we think we are.” It doesn't get any more local than this. Great place for a snack after a night in the bars. Sit at the counter for best view of the shenanigans and order breakfast anytime at this old school divey diner. ",
"It's hard to go wrong at this Cochon annex, where Link Group shows off its incredible charcuterie skills and even more incredible sandwiches. The muffuletta is one of the best in town, but it's hard to go wrong with anything from a Cubano to a serving of boudin.",
"Cochon Butcher’s Cajun pork hot dog is a beauty to behold, even if the bun can barely contain the meat. The frankfurters are made in house and don’t have a casing, so don’t expect the snap that’s so common when biting into a hot dog. The spot often has dogs on the “specials” menu with different toppings, so be sure to look for those. And, of course, there’s the rest of the glorious menu. ",
"The main course comes raw so you can cook it at home: whole hogs, boudin stuffed turkey, free range turkey, jambalaya stuffed chicken. What you’re not cooking at home is the sides, breads, and desserts: oyster and cornbread dressing, green bean casserole, mac and cheese, gumbo, rolls, pumpkin pie, and more. Orders must be placed by Saturday, November 18. Pick up on Tuesday, November 21 or Wednesday, November 22. Full menu here.",
"This Garden District beauty made famous by renowned restaurateur Ella Brennan (who employed both Paul Prudhomme and Emeril Lagasse during her tenure) is known for its twenty-five cent martinis at lunch. Chef Tory McPhail also offers an affordable three-course prix-fixe special for about $35 or so, a steal for this landmark.",
"Though dinner is a popular time to dine at the iconic turquoise palace in the Garden District, lunch delivers the same experience at half the price — especially when twenty-five cent martinis make the rounds. Opt for two or three courses, $18-$34, and order a trifecta of martinis — three is the limit. Still thirsty? Order a French red or white for $5.99 a glass. ",
"Pricier than most, but with good reason. This Uptown landmark’s Réveillon menu weighs in with a whopping seven courses and isn’t for the faint of heart. Heavy doses of cream, including a cheese course. A highly inventive line up include lobster and grilled corn pudding and a foie gras and riesling pie a la mode. $100 per person.",
"Raw oysters, stiff drinks, and a huge beer list await at this casual Riverbend bar just down from the levee. There are televisions everywhere, so no matter where you sit the view will be just fine. If you get hungry, drop by Mr. Chill’s next door for a dynamite hot dog. And, in case you’re wondering, the celebrity/beer caricatures lining the walls were carved years ago by a former RISD student who found himself flipping burgers back in the kitchen.",
"This brewery, formerly Heiner Brau Brewery, is located in a former hardware store. The space also had past lives as a gymnasium and cotton processing warehouse. Brewery tours happen every Saturday at 11:30 am and 12:30 pm. Easily accessible from the Trace.",
"From the outside, this off-shoot of Jacques-imo’s restaurant appears like yet another unassuming spot on a bereft-looking stretch of Jefferson Highway. But come 11:30 weekdays the parking lot quickly fills with tradesmen’s trucks — and with good reason. Step inside to find not only find a vibrant, share-a-table lunchroom but some of the tastiest po-boys in town. Here generously packed fried shrimp and oyster po-boys spill onto the wax paper wrapping. With a friend? Consider splitting a 15” king size po-boy from the specialty menu: duck, cochon de lait, or fried green tomato with shrimp remoulade. A good insider’s pick for those out-of-town friends looking for the real deal. ",
"Local favorite Creole Creamery dishes out king cake ice cream this season — sweet cream and cinnamon ice cream with pieces of real king cake, cinnamon chips, and Mardi Gras sprinkles. If that sounds good, go nuts with an ice cream king cake: Eight big scoops of king cake ice cream, topped with purple, green, and gold vanilla créme anglaise, sprinkles, and cherries. There’s a baby inside too.",
"One of the more substantial Reveillon menu options with an amuse bouche plus five courses. Genuinely inspired first course options include: lamb with scallops and red beet puree, rabbit and sweetbreads fricassee, and foie-gras stuffed quail with cherry and pistachio chutney. The variety extends to an intriguing choice between four entree options: lamb, seafood, venison and in the ultimate Christmas touch, goose. $75 per person.",
"Look down as you enter to see the tiles embedded in the sidewalk from when this French Quarter storefront say “Angelo Brocato.” Indeed, the space once belonged to Angelo Brocato’s, the city most beloved gelato and cannoli maker. Fortunately, Croissant has kept its vintage tiled walls and handsome Italian looks. The result is a classic breakfast and lunch cafe that even on the hottest of days offers a haven of cool and respite. Plus, there’s a secret courtyard worth seeking out. Aside from tarts and mousses, traditional French baked goods include quiches, and of course, croissants. Sandwiches also available. Open daily from 6:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. Closed Tuesdays. ",
"Cutter’s is a sweet quirky neighborhood hole-in-the-wall with a mix of gay, straight, and everyone in between friendly clientele. Tuesday’s trivia night, organized by sometime bartender Marc Paradis, better known for his band Johnny Sketch & The Dirty Notes, is a hoot. Cutter’s is a gem.  ",
"This accommodating hole-in-the-wall is home to the bottomless Cajun Mary, a killer version of a bloody that comes with a boiled crawfish perched on the rim of the cup. Get breakfast any time, sausage gravy and biscuits, over-stuffed po-boys, burgers and the like, dished in a busy diner atmosphere within walking distance to Bourbon Street bars. ",
"An elegant charmer that has set the bar for North Shore restaurants since its opening in 1990 by Kenny LaCour and Kim Kringlie. The lump crabmeat and brie soup is a perennial favorite, but be sure to try the New Orleans barbecue shrimp and mussels, the lump crabmeat sandwich, and the liver and onions.",
"The original location, on Freret kicked off the city’s craze for hot dogs, sausages, and whatever toppings could fit on a bun. Since the early days of this hot dog hot spot, Dat Dog has announced plans to expand into Baton Rouge and Houston (25 locations expected to open here in the next few years). If you can’t get to the Freret location, check the website for other locations on Magazine, Frenchman, and Lakeside Mall. And do get the crawfish étouffée dog with crawfish sausage, étouffée, sour cream, onions, tomato, Creole mustard. ",
"Lots of excellent options from this iconic seafood restaurant in Bucktown. Fried turkey, smoked turkey, smoked Boston butt, and smoked beef brisket make up the meat options. Dressings (crabmeat, oyster, crawfish) and gravy are sold by the quart. Stuffed crab, stuffed crawfish, corn maque choux, stuffed mirliton, sweet potato casserole, and oyster patties make up the side dishes. Lots of soup and dessert options as well. ",
"Your probably deserve to end the year with a crab fat beignet. DTB on Oak Street has a decadent, $85 four-course menu with crab fat beignets topped with Cajun caviar, fois gras “almondine,” a NY strip with butter poached lobster, and more. Start the meal with a complimentary glass of Champagne and be sure to add the optional $40 wine and cocktail pairing to the dinner. Full menu here. Plus, this Riverbend spot puts you within walking distance of notorious dive bar Snake and Jake’s so that you can end your NYE in full debauchery. ",

Prices won’t break the bank — get biscuits and gravy for $4.99 and an eight-ounce New York strip for $13.99 ($10.99 Tuesday and Thursdays) including a baked potato. There’s a full bar, local beer on tap, and a regular cast of characters that make for fine people watching.  ",
"The menu changes often at this intimate, high hospitality North Shore gem situated in the heart of downtown Covington. Husband-and-wife chef team David and Torre Solazzo build creative and elegant Italian cuisine from local products, building off their shared experience working at legendary Napa Italian restaurant, Tra Vigne (where they met). Plus, there’s an award-winning wine list and great happy hour. ",
"The menu changes often at this intimate, high hospitality North Shore gem from chefs and husband and wife team David and Torre Solazzo. The menu is creative and elegant. Great happy hour too. Easily accessible to the Trace. Also right by the Southern Hotel.",
"Upscale, detail-oriented Desi Vega’s Steakhouse has a Thanksgiving to-go menu with all the traditional dishes, including turtle soup, gumbo, salad, creamed spinach, shrimp and mirliton dressing, and more. All orders must be placed by the close of business on November 17. Pick up by the end of business on November 22.

"New Orlean’s is a city full of traditions and Friday lunch is an important one. Dickie Brennan’s Steakhouse sees that and raises it $1 martinis from 11:30 to 2:30 p.m. on Fridays. Order the two-course prix fixe for $19.98 (the year the restaurant opened) or a la carte (barbecue shrimp and grits, steak salad, and other options). Note: The limit is three $1 martinis (or other classic cocktail), no more and no less than what it takes for a three-martini lunch.",
"District elevated New Orleans’ doughnut game when it opened in 2013, and the spot now has over one hundred different doughnut variations, but the one to have during Carnival is the king cake donut. They go fast, so get there early. Also, the District’s actual king cake this year is inspired by the Italian cuccidati cookie with brioche dough spiked with cinnamon, and stuffed with fig, walnut, raisin, date, orange, and spices, so try that too while you’re there. ",
"Diva Dog’s stall in Roux Carre gives a reliable presence to the super-popular food truck. Hot dog diva Ericka Lassair slings hot dogs with Creole toppings— including a red beans and rice dog and a crawfish étouffée dog— on toasty brioche buns. Other sinful options include étouffée fries and étouffée nachos, a crabmeat grilled cheese, and a Zapps potato chip dog. Look for the food truck at events around town as well.",
"The longtime po-boy destination in the “sliver by the river” has something of a cult following. Step under the hand-painted sign and enter into a no-frills time warp of formica and wooden paneling. But know that this beloved eatery has been serving up po-boys to hungry New Orleanians for decades. Like the Parkway Bakery, Domilise’s has a long history tied to the city’s working class and this year marks the 100th anniversary of the family business. Both fried seafood and roast beef debris are favorites here. Worth noting: Tuesdays and Thursdays, 20% off for Tulane and Loyola students with id. ",
"Domilise's is a po' boy institution dating back to 1918, and what many consider THE classic po' boy operation in New Orleans with fans even including Mario Batali. It's an incredibly delicious hole-in-the-wall experience, where you can't go wrong with a fried shrimp.",
"This Vietnamese bakery is a bit of a drive out to New Orleans East, but is honestly worth it, if you're interested in seeking out the best banh mi you'll ever have in your life.",
"For years this New Orleans East Vietnamese bakery’s perfectly crisp on the outside, soft on the inside take on french bread has been the undisputed reigning champ of po-boy loaves. This year, the recent James Beard Award winner made headlines when it announced that, after reports of scalping and fistfights, its highly sought after king cakes would be pulled from vendors and sold only at its Chef Menteur location. Always worth the drive for its banh mi, the bakery also offers a sampling of Vietnamese sweets such as moon cakes. Worth noting: Best bakery website. Ever. Dong Phuong’s animated site is so beautifully rendered that it could bring one to tears. Worth a visit in its own right.  ",
"Located on the outskirts of New Orleans in da East, this 30 year-old bakery reflects perfectly traditional Vietnamese cooking and baking, which includes a heavy influence from the French occupation of Vietnam. The Banh Mi is served on freshly baked French bread. Diners get to choose from 17 different fillings for the sandwich, from cold cuts to Chinese sausage or toasted fish patty.",
"The buffet at this Treme landmark, where nonagenarian chef Leah Chase still checks in on the dining room, will only set you back about $18 and includes basically everything you came to town for— gumbo, fried chicken, fried catfish, greens, lima beans and soul.",
"Dryades Market has an extensive menu of Thanksgiving take-out, basically requiring you to cook absolutely nothing. Three different kinds gumbo; fried turkey sold by quarters, halves, or whole; multiple potato options; veg options; turkey dressing; eggplant dressing; gravy; cranberry sauce; and pies. Order by Monday, November 20 and pick up on Wednesday, November 23. View the full menu here.",

"Grab the things that are going to make your holiday table really special here. Marinated crab claws, seafood gumbo, mini crab cakes, and oyster and cornbread dressing among others. Call (504)323-9123 or email info@elysianseafood.com to order. ",
"Emeril’s goes nuts with king cake monkey bread, which is king cake dough tossed with cinnamon sugar and topped with vanilla icing and Mardi Gras-colored sugar. The flavors have been changing throughout the season. Strawberry and Creole cream cheese runs through February 5 followed by cookies and cream, which runs through February 12. If you’re curious what you missed already: Smores was on through January 22, while coconut was the flavor du jour through January 29.",
"Just a few steps from Bourbon’s mayhem, the Rose offers a pocket of cozy respite. Slim, unpretentious, and outfitted with a classic long bar, this perennial local favorite evokes a small Irish pub. Grab a pint or a whiskey and transition from day to night or refuel with banh mi from the Killer Poboys window in back before heading out into the night. Or drink like a local and stay for hours while catching up with an old friend. Four dollars and under “Wake Up and Live!” specials (10 a.m-2 p.m.) include bloody Marys and frozen Irish coffee. ",
"The quintessential neighborhood bar is an Irish bar through and through. The original owners came from Belfast in the 1990s and opened the kind of spot they remembered from home in 2002. It is now owned by a former regular and fellow Irishman. It’s a popular place to catch European football, but come Super Bowl Sunday the screens will be tuned to the NFL. Plus, there are tons of bar games to enjoy if the game isn’t as riveting as you expected, and a decent food menu with curry fries and more.",
"Buffet dinner, open bar, and live music on this iconic steamboat. Boarding begins at the Toulouse Street Wharf at 9:30 p.m. with the boat departing shortly after, and cruising until midnight. Catch amazing views of the fireworks and a party on board until 12:30 a.m. Tickets are $175 per person. More details here.",
"Miss Carol runs a tight ship at this no-frills 7th Ward bar on the corner of Pauger and Marais. And that’s a good thing in a gritty neighborhood that continues to straddle tradition and see an influx of newcomers and AirBnBers. Cassandra, the bartender welcomes all, the juke box is loaded with soul and R&B tunes, and there’s always some kind of party going on. ",
"New Orleanians love Five Happiness, a sprawling eatery on Carrollton since 1979. Named for the Chinese tradition of five kinds of happiness: longevity, wealth, health, virtue, and peaceful death, Five Happiness adds a full belly to the list. The crispy whole fish with black bean sauce is a winner, ditto the Peking duck, which comes with ten thin crepes for bundling. Lots of rooms and big tables, so this place works well for large parties. ",
"This sprawling new bar with 7,000 square feet of outdoor seating has a king cake daiquiri this season. Plus, the bar is conveniently located to the parade route, making it a convenient stop to grab a drink without missing much. Plus, there’s a full menu for snacks.",
"The Fountain Lounge’s lunch-only, three-course meal serves up a solid, budget-minded choice for those looking to partake more lightly. The three entree choices feature cool weather flavors: puppy drum with winter squash hash, rosemary strip loin roast with Abita demi-glace, or cherry-glazed smoked duck breast. Plus, it’s inside the gloriously decked-out-for-the-holidays Roosevelt Hotel. $24 per person.",
"A sign posted at this corner store says it all: “No wifi at Fradys, sit down and talk.” More known for its breakfast and lunch plates than for “making groceries,” this joint is old school and proud of it. Frady’s is about as basic as it gets; orders are to go and buyer beware, cash only. The fried shrimp and oyster or dripping roast beef with provolone are good bets. Consider following the sign’s advice and chow down at one of the shaded benches out front with a friend or, perhaps, make a new one? ",
"Off-beat decor, outlandish stories, and longtime characters spell “a good feeling” for Evans whenever she steps into this Bywater corner spot. “It’s the kind of corner store you write home to your mother about. I did,” she says. Menus include tiny muffalettas, stuffed mirliton, a Thursday beef liver and onion plate, as well as the $5 “grumpy old man” breakfast plate. ",
"We live in a world of souped-up milkshakes, as evidenced by the many viral Instagram shakes of the world. It’s possible Frey Smoked Meat has outdone them all with its king cake a la mode  made with none other than hometown favorite, James Beard Award-winning Dong Phuong king cake. The vanilla milkshake is all dressed up with purple, green, and gold sugar, topped with whipped cream, and a big slice of Dong Phuong king cake. And — yes -- there’s a baby on it. ",
"Nestled between the party hardy bars and strips clubs of Bourbon, Fritzel’s remains in a bohemian class all its own. While mostly known for its nightly swing jazz shows, Fritzel’s offers a respite from the cover bands that otherwise dominate the strip. Raffish, divey, and unapologetically nostalgic, Fritzel’s remains dear even to locals despite its heavily touristed location. This style of Dixieland jazz skews towards a more mature crowd, so those looking for edge should head elsewhere. Decent beer selection and full bar. FYI: If you’re looking to sit, a hostess will direct you. Be forewarned, the club is small and often packed and the bleacher style seating isn’t cush. Fritzel’s is most likely better suited for a round or two alone with a friend rather than an all nighter with a pack of buddies. No cover but one drink minimum per set.",
"This Bourbon Street landmark is famous for its Friday lunch, where the drinks are strong and the menu is bursting with classics— Oysters Rockefeller, Eggs Sardou, Galatoire Goute, Pompano with crabmeat. Show up early to stand in line (and bring a jacket, gentlemen).",
"Although it’s not a restaurant, this spacious Asian supermarket carries a spinning globe of international ingredients along with prepared foods to take away. Head towards the back on the right for glistening, lacquered Peking duck and slices of red hued char siu (Chinese barbecued pork), fragrant with with soy sauce, hoisin sauce, and Chinese five-spice powder. Plus, satisfy a Vietnamese craving too with the cheap and good banh mi.",
"There’s hardly a place more appropriate to celebrate NYE than this charming wine bar that makes Champagne the star of the show all year long. Recently named Eater NOLA’s Bar of the Year, Effervescence is throwing a Gatsby New Year’s Eve Champagne celebration with live music by Harry Mayronne and Friends. The 5 p.m. seating includes a Taittinger welcome toast. The 9 p.m. seating includes a midnight Champagne tower toast. Food includes caviar, truffles, oysters, lobster, and steak. $80 per person. By reservation only. Full menu here. (Bubbles served all evening to walk-in guests.)",
"Perfectly located for late night munching after Frenchmen Street or St. Claude Avenue bar hopping, Gene’s Po-Boys in the Marigny is as no-frills as they come. Don’t let the Pepto-Bismol pink exterior put you off — the sandwiches are hearty and cheap. The hot sausage and cheese is a best seller, and rightfully so. Come with patience; service can be a bit slow. Lagniappe: free drink with a po-boy. Best of all: ALWAYS open. ",
"At Gene’s, you won’t waste any time reading over a long menu. There are only four choices and they are all poboys: Creole hot sausage, steak and cheese, hamburger, or shrimp. “Just don’t blame me if you smell like garlic and seasoning for a week,” says Evans. A bonus: $4 Canebreak beer on tap. ",
"This no frills joint on the corner of Elysian Fields and St. Claude feeds hordes of hungry club-goers spilling out of Siberia, Allways, and MAGS in the wee hours, and with good reason. Inside the Pepto-pink building the po-boys are massive: foot-longers stuffed with the likes of hot sausage and cheese, hamburger, and fried catfish. Yes, it’s a greasy little joint without much ambiance and just two tables, so order that sandwich to go or bring it next door to Melvin’s Bar and have another beer. ",
"This spot is located on a corner of Magazine Street, in the middle of all the shopping. The Chicago-style beef hot dog comes on a poppy seed bun with relish galore, and a side of fries or chips. The big menu with cocktails, salads, hearty sandwiches, and more.",
"Simultaneously divey and charming and very faintly pagoda-esque, the Golden Lantern is like its name, welcoming and slightly magical. Somehow this 24-hour watering hole manages to feel more removed from the world than most bars; it also offers an incredibly generous daily happy hour lasting from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Gay-centered but straight-friendly, it’s where one could imagine Blanche DuBois would have eventually ended up sipping rum and cokes on rainy afternoons had she not been so undone by Stanley. Free live entertainment, including drag shows on the weekends. ",
"The fact that Gracious now has three locations speaks for itself. Gracious’ initial location on Jefferson Davis Avenue found quick fans among the employees upstairs at Woodward Design and Build Co. But word of this upbeat, modern, and light-filled breakfast and lunch spot from pastry chef Megan Forman quickly spread and with good reason: Gracious serves up satisfying sandwiches on homemade bread that don’t leave one in a fried food coma. The chicken tarragon and meatloaf options are good bets. Gracious also offers a small breakfast menu (build-your-own breakfast sandwiches offer lots of options) and outstanding baked goods, including baguettes, sourdough boules, and ciabatta, patisseries as well as deeply, deeply satisfying cookies that are difficult to resist while waiting to place an order. Whole cakes and pies also available. Good to know: Gracious offers bread-making classes.  ",
"Marvin Matherne has owned this 60+ year old, petite lunch staple since 1992, and he’s always in the kitchen making the po-boys himself, chatting with customers as he stuffs well-seasoned shrimp inside po-boy loaves (to the point that they are falling out of the sandwich) and slathering them with mayo before topping with pickles, lettuce, tomato, and ketchup.Indeed, the fried shrimp po-boy is one of the best the city has to offer. (There’s also a very good grilled shrimp po-boy.) Seating is extremely limited and payment is cash only. Note: Unlike other spots that leave the ketchup application to the customer, Guy’s defines “dressed” as lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, and ketchup.",
"The upside is also the downside of this communal-style restaurant: It’s only open during crawfish season. Those lucky enough to make the trip during that season are met with impossibly sweet (due to a purging process developed at Texas A&M) and peppery boiled crawfish. It’s also listed as one of Eater’s 38 best restaurants in the South.",
"Now in its third generation, this family-owned bakery on Jefferson Highway is best known for the tens of thousands of king cakes it produces each Carnival season (many of which are shipped out of state) and its custom designed confections, including wedding cakes. Haydel’s is old school, caring little for pretension or fad. While other bakeries on this list may look to Europe for inspiration, Haydel’s remains firmly rooted in New Orleans and Cajun country with Saints-themed cupcakes and the Cajun Kringle, a praline-filled couronne topped with a caramel glaze and pecans.  ",
"This cozy, memorabilia-filled hole-in-the-wall in Shreveport has been serving the community for about 80 years. The most popular item, the “shrimp buster,” was added to the menu in the 1940s, after a family member returned from war in the South Pacific and described the butterfly shrimp he had there. The Herby K’s version is butterfly shrimp pounded thin and fried, served with a “secret” dipping sauce. The shrimp étouffée, gumbo, onion rings, and a giant crab cake are all worthy of stomach real estate too.",
"Pizza and inexpensive, flavorful vegan fare draw Evans to this Bywater corner spot. “In the back hides an unexpected, delicious food discovery called the ‘Pizza Garage,’ she says. “Caribbean flavors offer a bite of the unexpected. If you’re a regular, Chef Karen will whip you up a personal dish.”  ",
"The Carousel Bar was always one of the most beautiful, delightful bars in the city. But a 2011 renovation that opened up the space for more seating and a music stage has now arguably made the Carousel one of the most glamorous spots to drink in the country. Sartorially spiffy bartenders add to the ambiance as they ply guests with classics, including the in-house specialty, the Vieux Carre. And yes, the Carousel does actually move. It takes about fifteen minutes for a seat to circumnavigate the bar. Plan your drinking accordingly.",
"James Beard Award-winning bartending whiz Chris Hannah picks Igor’s as the place to grab a to-go bloody Mary when you’re in the Garden District. Besides that, it has outdoor seating, laundry facilities, and pool tables. Open 24 hours. ",
"Come lunch, this Carrollton corner store does a solid hot plate business among on-the-go tradesmen. Rotating specials include stuffed peppers, smothered turkey necks, red beans, fried catfish, mac and chees,e and greens. Looking to host quick? Jake’s carries the goods for an impromptu barbecue: an extensive beer selection, including local craft brews, and a genuine meat counter. ",
"This bright and tidy corner store off Orleans Avenue features a full service take away kitchen that includes Vietnamese, Chinese and New Orleans dishes, with ya-ka-mein always on the menu.  The pork flavor is spiked with char siu roasted pork, giving the broth a reddish hue, helped along by a generous squirt of hot sauce. ",
"Mid City dining destination Vessel, housed in a former church with soaring ceilings and stained glass windows, might be the coolest dinner spot to bid adieu to 2017. The restaurant is no stranger to the late night dining game with its last seating at 11 p.m. on every Friday and Saturday and midnight on Sundays. Chef Eric Sibley has a five-course pre fixe with a glass of bubbles for $62, which also makes it a relatively affordable option for the night.",
"Walk through the red door and under the red silk lanterns into Jung’s, a popular spot for traditional Chinese-American fare, with a few Korean and Thai dishes thrown into the mix. A fixture in New Orleans for close to four decades, Jung’s keeps prices low even for specialty items on their Chinese menu, which offers the likes of boiled fish in hot sauce, spicy pan-fried chicken, and fiery ma po tofu. For the more conservative of palate go-tos include shrimp with lobster sauce and pork fried rice. The dinner combination plates are a great deal, the likes of General chicken and pepper steak priced under $13 and served with shrimp fried rice and spring roll.",
"With an extensive 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. happy hour, day-drinking inevitably devolves into nightly crooning at this beloved St. Claude karaoke den. The crowd is rabid for karoake, not in a snarky way, they’re full-on supportive to all. It happens every night of the week and it’s a great time.  ",
"This specialty grocery in Krotz Springs is a one-stop shop for deer sausage, alligator, rabbits stuffed with green onion pork sausage, and boudin (smoked, pork, crawfish, alligator) to take home and stock the freezer. Ready-to-eat delicacies include smoked boudin, cracklins, beef jerky, hog’s head cheese, crawfish boudin balls, pork boudin balls, and a boudin ball stuffed with jalapeño and cream cheese. Tidy and tiny T-Boo’s shares the parking lot with Kartchner’s, bringing freshly baked crawfish bread, sno-balls, pistolettes, and shrimp burgers to the table. ",
"While The Little Gem has a several dinner seatings accompanied by live music on New Year’s Eve, the  most coveted is between 7 p.m. and and 8 p.m. during the Kermit Ruffins and the BBQ Swingers show. A NYE four-course prix fixe dinner is available from 5:30 p.m. to 11 p.m. for $80 including crab bisque and caviar, filet mignon, lobster tail, mushroom risotto, and more. Wine pairings optional. Vegetarian prix fixe available upon request. If you miss the dinner show, Kermit Ruffins plays again at 10:30 p.m. for the Black and White Ball. Tickets and info on the website. ",
"What began as a pop-up and then expanded to become a order window hot spot at the back of the Erin Rose bar, has since added a second “big” French Quarter location on Dauphine with tables (open until 8). Both Killers offer much needed chow-down, budget-friendly options while strolling the Quarter. But don’t come to Killer Po-boys looking for dyed-in-the-wool traditional po-boys, but rather an inventive departure from the genre. For example, it may have the only smoked salmon po-boy in town. What earns Killers a spot on this list of greats? Crafted, cosmopolitain combos that pack world-class street food into a loaf, from the popular glazed pork belly to the veg friendly roasted sweet potato to the Latin-inspired chorizo and avocado. And all for $13 and under.",
"No shortage of Uptown huff has surrounded this longtime Magazine street bakery since Donald Link and partner Stephen Stryjewski took over from the previous (French) owners in 2015. The iconic blue facade and French inspiration remain, though some longtime clients remain très distraught at perceived filling and flavor changes. What is undeniable: La Boulangerie’s impressive selection of hearty breads, among them the splurge-worthy olive fougasse, the blue cheese, and rosemary with sea salt loaves. Sandwiches served all day, including Boulangerie’s uptake on the egg McMuffin. Pastry Chef Maggie Scales’ handiwork includes no shortage of wondrous sweets and cakes. (Scales is the pastry chef for the whole Link Restaurant Group.) Notable: La Boulangerie uses locally milled whole wheat flour, Louisiana honey, and raw sugar. ",
"This Bayou St. John po' boy staple is a favorite among locals and tourists in the know. The fried shrimp is a classic, but it's the Thanksgiving po' boy that has locals lining up around the block on Wednesdays in November. Bonus: An excellent Reuben and gumbo.",
"After stints with pop-ups, farmer’s markets, and a Kickstarter campaign, this River Ridge newcomer at last opened its doors this past December. Named for co-owners and chefs Lya and Jeff Becnel’s beloved daughter, La Petite Sophie offers what may be the area’s best croissant selection. Both Becnels bring their extensive training (she: Le Cordon Bleu; he: CIA) and impressive experience in both American and German restaurants to bear on some nine sweet and savory varieties of the French breakfast staple, including chocolate almond, kumquat, and ham and cheese. However, the start may be kouign amann, Brittany’s salted caramel take on the pastry. Also available: sweet buns, quiches, muffins, palmiers, and soft German pretzels. ",
"Is La Provence still worth the drive after the stunning sale of the once John Besh owned restaurant? Absolutely. Texas natives Chef Eric Hunter and Jennifer Pittman Hunter, the new owners, lived on the property for months learning about the food and everything else. Eric Hunter, who grew up on the North Shore, has known John Besh since their sisters were roommates in college. Should we expect changes? Not really, but keep a look out for some cool wine tastings (some from Texas, where the Hunters moved from) and maybe some a retail side of the restaurant. Trust us, John Besh took the sale of La Provence very seriously and chose the best person for its next era. It’s also accessible from the Trace.",
"Chef Eric Hunter and Jennifer Pittman Hunter run this country style French dining destination on picturesque grounds with several acres of kitchen garden and space for the pigs and bees that are raised onsite. The menu is as thoughtful and precise as it gets. Plus the restaurant forgoes traditional bread and butter service in lieu of toast points and pâté. Look out for some cool wine tastings (some from the Hunters’ native Texas) and maybe a retail side of the restaurant in the future.",
"There are old buildings in the French Quarter and then there are old. Now coming up on its 300th birthday, Lafitte’s is reputed to be the oldest building used as a bar in the U.S. The iconic brick and beam Creole cottage construction is a standout even in a neighborhood of standouts, and is believed to have been the storehouse of New Orleans privateer Jean Lafitte. The bar continues to attract visitors less for its cocktail program than for its candle lit, rustic, and yes, piratey atmosphere. And while Lafitte’s gets bustling come night, its lower Bourbon location puts some breathing room between it and the strip club scene. Keep the drinks simple here.",
"This bakery and cafe has found a sweet spot (sorry!) in a pocket of Broad (at one time, it was actually on Laurel Street) that for years was in desperate need of one. Step inside sunny and hip Laurel Street Bakery, and it’s hard not to feel an uptick in good vibes. More than anything, it’s bagels that rule the day with a solid selection including spreads, all made in-house. Schmear options include shallot and bacon, date and honey, pimento olive, and lox. Bagel lovers looking to feed a family or group will appreciate “brown bag” to go options. Those looking to catch up with a friend or get in a little work will appreciate hearty bagel breakfast sandwiches; and come lunch, sandwiches are served on regular sliced bread. And yes, sweets do abound: cakes, cupcakes, cookies, brownies, rolls — you get the picture. Open 7 days",
"New Orleans doesn’t have a horse in the game, so why not watch the game at Liberty Cheesesteaks (New Orleans’ unofficial home of the Philadelphia Eagles) eating Philadelphia’s most iconic food? This past year, the cheesesteak hub (co-owned by a Philly native) moved into a larger location with plenty of seating, televisions, and a full bar. Follow the restaurant’s Facebook page to watch all the Eagles hype videos you can handle.",
"This LGD staple is where numerous locals go to get their lunchtime pho fill. Many consider the broth here to be the best in town, but the menu is also home to numerous Vietnamese classics that won't break the bank.",
"This friendly little joint on Williams Boulevard near the airport has a massive menu of darn good traditional Chinese fare. Get the salt and pepper oysters if they’re on special or try the Peking duck, a rare find at most New Orleans Chinese spots.  (The pancakes are bun style, not the thin kind, but very good). The $6.95 lunch specials are a stupid good value. Avoiding fried? Try the chicken lettuce wraps,  a light dish that doesn’t include a side of guilt. ",
"Come Jazz Fest, this popular, laid back, horse-themed corner joint by the track is like its po-boys, overflowing. The New Orleans-style barbecue shrimp po-boy (difficult to contain so grab a fork) remains a popular option, but the stunner is the fried oyster with garlic butter. Both highly splittable to leave room for fries. Lunch or early dinner; closes at 7:30. ",
"Celebrating its tenth year of business in Covington, Lola restaurant comes from Nealy Frentz and her husband Keith Frentz, both chefs. The Southern-centered spot is located in the historic Covington depot and serves a casual lunch Monday-Friday and and upscale dinner Thursday-Saturday. Think: chargrilled Spanish octopus, crawfish cakes, and shrimp and grits (pork belly, Tin Roof shrimp broth, grilled bread). Plus, these two were once crowned the King and Queen of Louisiana Seafood. If you are doing the Tammany Trace bike option, this is a restaurant that is right on the Trace.",
"With a front balcony overlooking picturesque St. Charles Avenue, this dive bar and laundromat is conveniently located on the streetcar line. Besides decent pub food like pizzas and burgers and a bloody Mary made without the help of a mix, this LGD staple even has live music and karaoke from-time-to-time. Open 24 hours.",
"Despite sitting in the shadow of the 1-10 overpass, purple-hued Manchu continues to draw lines for its fried chicken. “Two years ago I was standing on the corner of Claiborne and Esplanade shooting second line footage. It was the first day of shooting for Corner Stores,” Evan recalls. “Out of deep foodie passion and pure New Orleans kindness, one of the dancers ordered me a 6-piece meal of Manchu fried chicken. Supremely seasoned. Cooked to perfection. Manchu, I love you.” Manchu, also known for yakamein, is on Eater’s list of 38 essential New Orleans restaurants. ",
"Although the low-slung purple building at the corner of Claiborne and Esplanade is known for its crack wings (and with good reason), this family-owned eatery also dishes Chinese food, po- boys and egg rolls in numbers meant for tailgating.  The mamas in the kitchen also prepare ya-ka-mein to order, stir-frying the noodles and adding bits of what tastes almost like corned beef to the broth. ",
"A sports bar on steroids, this Archie Manning-owned CBD spot is all about big booths, big patio, big screens, big beers, and — if you’re lucky and plan ahead - big, leather reclining chairs. Easy parking in the Harrah’s garage make Manning’s a popular game day destination. For the Super Bowl, the bar is offering food and beverage packages (four-course menu and open bar during the game) for $200 on the lower level and $250 per person on the upper. The bar and courtyard will be open on a first come, first served basis with a limited menu. Call 504-593-8118 to reserve a package.",
"It’s not surprising that many bakeries draw from European influences; however Maple Street Patisserie’s charming master baker and pastry chef Ziggy Chichowski, is, in fact, European. The dedication to craft and traditional Viennese and French goods are evident in Maple Street’s beautifully rendered cakes, pastries, and repertoire of classic breads. A low key but warm spot to grab and cup of coffee and a breakfast treat (sausage biscuits are divine); those seeking more substance, will find lunch sandwiches on house-baked bread. File under you may (or may not) want to know: All of Chef Ziggy’s gorgeous cakes can be had in 6” sizes. The chocolate with hazelnut filling delivers. ",
"“Don’t be fooled by the plain, brick entryway—Mardi Gras Zone is an almost mythical touchstone in New Orleans’ wild rough of corner stores,” says Evans. She suggests starting with an elephant-ear sized slice of pizza (vegan available) fresh out of the wood-burning stove. If it’s Monday, be prepared to stand in line as red beans and rice are on the house. ",
"This longtime cash-only neighborhood bar is rife with colorful regulars. It’s the kind of place to throw back $2 beers, shoot some pool, and — if opportunity knocks — grab a condom from the fishbowl near the bar. You can add good grub to that list now as well, as Tres Barnard is again serving up Southern-inspired bar food with the brand new Marie’s Kitchen Fridays through Sundays from 5 p.m. to midnight.",
"Serving the Bywater area since the 1940s, the bar thankfully hasn’t changed as much as the area around it. In fact, the clientele is a cool little mix of old-school regulars and hipsters that have only recently docked in New Orleans. Markey’s is also a great spot to watch the game with large televisions, an ample selection of draft beer, pub grub, and speedy bartenders. ",
"There’s nothing corner store about the daily ya-ka-mein that runs $18 on the menu at Meauxbar, the swank North Rampart restaurant across from Armstrong Park.  Chef John Bel riffs off tradition, upgrading the beef to short ribs or rib eye, using bits of fried chicken skin for garnish, generally upping the ante on what might just be the ultimate comfort bowl. ",
"Because you’re doing laundry and you deserve a dirty banana daiquiri and a po-boy. The laundry facilities are actually located next door to this iconic, post-Katrina po-boy spot on Elysian Fields. Melba’s is open 24 hours, and breakfast starts at midnight.",
"“Eat Pray Love” proclaims a sign outside of this neighborhood staple on busy Claiborne Avenue. As in “Eat at Melba’s, Pray before meals, and Love New Orleans.” If that’s not enough to get you in the door, consider the long list of frozen daiquiris, every possible kind of over stuffed po-boy (there must be 30 shrimp in that thing!) and the shrimp and grits is perfect any time of day. There just happens to be a laundromat next door that offers free dryers after midnight, in case you need to do a few loads while you munch. ",
"Meribo, pronounced Muh-REE-bo, combines the two Italian words meridionale (southern) and cibo (food) to indicate the restaurant's dedication to combining southern Italian recipes with American southern ingredients, like wild boar and Benton's bacon. The interior is clean and modern and mostly white with floor-to-ceiling windows and chrome and red accents. The restaurant is known as a pizzeria (and an excellent one at that), but be sure to consider other dishes, like the crawfish boil gnocchi or crispy chicken livers, as well. It’s just off Tammany Trace.",
"This Mid City favorite has it going on when it comes to games with crawfish boils, outdoor and indoor seating, and great drink specials. Plus, there are plenty of TV screens: four 26″, five 42″, two 50″, one 70″, and one 120″ projector. Menu items include solid New Orleans-style pub grub: crawcheese fries, debris fries, an alligator sausage dog and more.",
"Located between Lake Maurepas and Lake Pontchartrain, Middendorf’s restaurant put thin-fried catfish on the map. It opened in 1934, but the building has been rebuilt over and over again after being knocked down by hurricanes. Outside seating means gorgeous views of the lake.",
"Tucked away by a Lakeview shopping center, Ming’s isn’t a typical Chinese joint. This Cantonese restaurant is open, airy, sans red dragon decor, and offers outside seating. There are cheap traditional lunch specials but chef and owner Ming Joe has a few tricks up his sleeve. Besides the usuals for dinner, try the crawfish velvet, a riff on shrimp with lobster sauce and a sultry moo shu pork, with five pancakes. You might need more. Check out the happy hour 4:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. Monday through Saturday for drink specials (2 for 1 Tsingtao, $5 Mai Tais) and a menu of $2-$6 dumplings and egg rolls.  ",
"Punchy and cheap, Molly’s has long been a go-to for locals needing to meet up with visiting groups of chatty, non-fussy friends. While it’s lower Decatur location makes it a useful pit stop for those heading to or returning from the music clubs on Frenchmen Street, plenty of folks seem content to hang out here for hours. Keep cocktails simple: Five bucks will buy a frozen Irish coffee, Moscow mule, or a dark and stormy, but for the most part, Molly’s is a beer and chaser sort of joint. Local brews on draught.",
"Yes, Morning Call has beignets — fresh fried and showered with confectioners sugar. But this City Park gem also dishes decent jambalaya, gumbo, and muffulettas. Plus, the beer is cheap, and there’s an oversized patio with free wifi. Tie in the proximity to gorgeous live oaks and the Sculpture Garden, and Morning Call is a secret weapon of comfort food. ",
"A Louisiana-style Italian restaurant in a white clapboard building with real ties to the mafia, this unassuming institution once inspired an entire story in the New Yorker. The jukebox offers a solid side of Louis Prima to go with specialties like chicken a la grande, oysters Mosca, and perfectly al dente pasta. It’s like entering the Italian heart of New Orleans.",
"Another impeccably run restaurant from a member of the Brennan family (Cindy Brennan in this case), this bustling French Quarter spot is filled with big names in New Orleans business during weekday lunch. They’re slurping glistening bowls of gumbo ya ya and dunking French bread into bowls of New Orleans-style barbecue shrimp — and wearing bibs while doing it. It helps that Mr. B’s pours $1.50 martinis (and bloody Marys) during weekday lunch. Order as many as you like; nobody is counting. ",
"Mr. Chill’s, which took over a former tattoo shop next to Cooter Brown’s, is a family friendly spot with bright yellow walls that really does have first class hot dogs, split down the middle to maximize that backyard grill flavor and placed on a bun that has the sweetness of a brioche. Tons of toppings and specialty dogs. Plus, save room for the best slice of 7-UP pound cake that you’ve ever had. The place is warm and friendly and feels like an old school New Orleans snack stand that graduated into a restaurant -- with honors.",
"This neighborhood bar at the intersection of Magazine and Napoleon is always open, so stop in for a drink and a game of pool or air hockey any time of day or night. Get too wasted and you might just earn a spot on the Wall Of Shame. Cash only and don’t whine about it. Open 24/7.",
"Bloody Marys, vodka, or gin martinis and red and white wine pour for $4 during lunch at Muriel’s, located just off Jackson Square. The $18.95 two-course lunch special includes the likes of blackened catfish, étouffée, and pork chops, but the a la carte entree salads from chef Erik Veney are excellent. Try the Cobb with extra blue cheese dressing on the side. ",
"This four-course plus eggnog menu from this French Quarter icon offers both lighter and heavier options, all with Louisiana-inspired flavors. For the truly ravenous: a first course of fried oyster chowder with corn, leeks, potato, and applewood bacon starter or the seared venison with port wine and currant reduction entree. $55 per person.",
"Originally built as a refuge for Napolean Bonaparte, this 200-year-old townhouse exudes the sort of exquisite, romantic decay that epitomizes the French Quarter. With its peeling plaster walls, exposed beams, classic polished bar and opera arias playing in the background, time seems to stand still here, and it’s easy to see why the building has been the subject of countless photographs, including photo spreads for Anthropologie. Classics, such as a Pimm’s Cup, Aperol Sptriz, or BouIevardier are all good bets and can be had for under $10. Note the Napolean House keeps restaurant hours and closes at 10 p.m.",
"University area residents in the late 1990s will remember Cake Cafe owner Steve Himlefarb walking around Maple Street peddling his plastic-wrapped cake slices held high above his head on a round tray. It’s been more than a minute since then and years now since he graduated big time into the quirky and funky French Quarter brick-and-mortar cafe loved for its cakes, breakfast, and add-a-cupcake-for-$1 option in the French Quarter. Plus, his boozy cupcakes are a perfect fit for the city. As the name of his cafe makes clear, the core of his business is still the fluffy cakes he once sold from business-to-business and door-to-door.",
"There’s an outpost of this beloved Gretna Chinese and Vietnamese restaurant on Conti in the French Quarter, but the original has a much larger menu and is worth a trip. Try the house specialty: grilled beef, chicken, squid, and shrimp, prepared fondue-style at the table and wrapped in lettuce with herbs. Closed Wednesdays.",
"Despite the disappointing addition of an outside sign, Pete’s is still a hidden gem that’s off the beaten path for most. Get buzzed in by the bartender and slurp cheap drinks at the surprisingly handsome circa-1930s bar. There’s a good jukebox, the game is usually on, and the crowd is friendly, the trifecta for a good neighborhood joint. ",
"Nancy Nguyen’s spotless Uptown bakery flies under the radar, situated in a house set back from the street next to a small strip shopping center on a lazy, shady stretch of Magazine, but inside she churns out perfectly executed, light-as-a-cloud buttercream cakes.mNguyen is much more accommodating than other bakers, often trying to get that last-minute cake ready (And sometimes she has some ready in the case). If committing to a cake is a bit much, be sure to scoop up a few of her lovely petit fours. Organize your visit around lunchtime and leave time to devour the chicken salad on a croissant. ",
"It’s not a manufacturing brewery but a brewpub, or restaurant that brews its own beer for on-site consumption only. The food is great and there’s a viewing window into the brewing operation. Plus it’s located just across from the Mandeville Trailhead, making it a perfect spot on a bicycle tour of the St. Tammany Trace.",
"After four feet of flood water in August 2017 destroyed the store’s inventory and refrigerators, this Mid-City corner spot of 30 years nearly had to fold. But support from neighbors, daily lunch specials, including a superlative red beans and rice plate, have kept Orleans Food Store open for business. Open daily from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.",
"Even though the North Shore isn't that far away, the trip over Lake Pontchartrain can make it seem like a road trip to another world. If you decide to go ahead and spend the night after a day of eating and drinking on the North Shore, you’re staying at the elegant Southern Hotel. And if you are staying at the elegant Southern Hotel (And even if you’re not), you’re eating at Oxlot 9. With a simple yet sophisticated approach to food, them menu changes often, but sometimes includes Royal Red shrimp ceviche, pork belly “yakamein,” and soft shell crawfish caprese. Also, check out the Sunday brunch, which features a “knife and fork” chicken biscuit, grillades and grits, and other items to get your a.m. fun started. It’s easily accessible from the Trace and ultra-close to Lola and Covington Brewhouse.",
"Housed within the elegant Southern Hotel, Oxlot 9 takes a simple and sophisticated approach to food. The menu changes often, but sometimes includes Royal Red shrimp ceviche, pork belly “yakamein,” and soft shell crawfish caprese. Also, check out the Sunday brunch, which features a “knife and fork” chicken biscuit, grillades and grits, and other items to get the a.m. fun started. ",
"Chef Jeffrey Hansell sets the bar high with his pork belly ""yaka mein” at Oxlot 9, an intimate farm-forward restaurant in the heart of downtown Covington on the Northshore.  Hansell’s version of the New Orleans staple starts with a bacon consomme swimming with udon noodles, napa cabbage kimchi, local mushrooms, kale and a soft poached yard egg. ",
"Don’t come to Pal’s expecting a Scene. Instead find locals chilling at this neighborhood bar not far from the Jazz Fest Fairgrounds. The drinks are a step up from most dives, with daily specials (mulled wine? sure!) and a food pop-up to keep the munchies at bay. There’s a buzzer outside, so push it: That’s how to enter the Pal’s portal. ",
"With its spacious and airy, turn-of-the-century dining room, the Palace Cafe offers a lovely spot to celebrate the season. The four-course menu includes one of the more distinct and decidedly festive salad options on this list: a crab and spinach salad with candied kumquats and gingerbread crouton. Entrees include pompano with a potato apple latke and caviar cream, a mustard crusted wild boar tenderloin, or veal blanquette with mushrooms, pearl onions and cream. $65",
"Accessible from the Tammany Trace, this spot is a ride. It’s about 19 miles past Old Rail Brewing, count on a bike ride (partly through Fountainbleu State Park) that will last about an hour and a half. That said, it’s a picturesque restaurant that covers the basics on its menu: crab cakes, trout amandine, and steaks.",
"The only place around that serves traditional dim sum from push carts, Panda King on the West Bank draws hordes to the Hong Kong brunch of steamed dumplings, baked buns, roasted duck, and pork, served on the weekends from 10:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. During the week, there’s a huge lunch buffet with the usual, along with the odd addition of spaghetti and meatballs and red beans and rice.  Ask about hot pots, simmering pots of broth with a variety of ingredients available, served daily from 5 to 10 p.m.  ",
"This long-time divey hang also has one of the best roast beef po’ boys in the city. Located in the heart of the Irish Channel on the corner of Constance and Third, it also serves as the unofficial epicenter of St. Patrick’s Day revelry, if you can make it through the sea of partiers. ",
"While this longtime Irish Channel corner dive attracts its fair share of out-of-towners, Parasol’s has remained true to its roots when the surrounding neighborhood was filled with working class Irish and German immigrants. Many devotees claim its well-seasoned, moderately priced roast beef po-boy is the city’s best. Others are partial to the firecracker shrimp po-boy. Either way, that Parasol’s is also a bar means that you can sit, sip, and chew a while, either solo or catching up with a friend. ",
"On a list of greats, few po-boy spots can match the iconic status of this classic Mid-City corner eatery. Indeed it doesn’t get more New Orleans than this. The Parkway’s doors first opened over a century ago, and it began serving po-boys to striking street car workers in the 1920s. Now two favorites, the over-stuffed fried shrimp and the roast beef and gravy, garner fervent followers. Also worth a mention for its rarity: the steamed corn beef brisket po-boy. It’s a great, casual neighborhood joint for those looking to chow down with friends. ",
"The Jeff Highway location of Piccadilly will close at the end of February. If this makes you sad, maybe load up on some Piccadilly goodness by the gallon this Thanksgiving? All the basics are available on what may be the easiest online Thanksgiving feast ordering form of all. Order a la carte or customize a package. Find the menu and ordering info here.",
"The faux Acadian, swamp decor and shopping area may say tourist trap, but the dark roux gumbo says quite the opposite. Other menu stunners include red beans and rice topped with blackened shrimp, eggplant pirogue Louis, as well as award-winning crawfish étouffée. Bonus: There’s a little dog run outside under a shade tree, so it’s perfect for folks traveling with their pooches. Ask the waitstaff for the key and fresh water for the bowls.",
"R&O’s, a family establishment in Bucktown since the 1980s, touts pizza as its primary trade, but the po-boys are legendary among native New Orleanians. It’s a full sit-down restaurant near the lake with a quick, efficient waitstaff that calls all the diners “sweetie” or “honey,” plenty of seating, cold beer, and a casual aesthetic that includes paper holiday decorations dangling from ceiling panels and a roll of paper towel on every table. Grab the R & O Special, a standard ham and roast beef po-boy, but with cabbage in lieu of the more traditional lettuce.  ",
"The quirky Marigny bar, known for attracting hipsters and old weirdos alike, is known for raucous game-day viewing. In short, total mayhem, food, and the possibility of a full-on brass band wandering in during half-time. ",
"For those wondering what it’s like to be part of a big, loud, New Orleans Italian family that still ticks by the old honor code, there is Radosta’s. The Radosta brothers came from the family behind Radosta’s Fine Foods, a grocery on South Carrollton between 1952 and the mid-70s and this little neighborhood po-boy spot hangs onto that grocery identity, though it’s much more known for its po-boys than it is for its meager aisles of non-perishables and booze. Walk straight to the back, order, grab a drink from any of the coolers or a bag of chips. Don’t worry about paying until it’s all consumed and time to leave. Then, just walk up to the cash register and let the Radostas know what you had. They trust you. The roast beef po-boy is a popular choice, though any of the po-boys are good. Additionally, the spot has a ton of Italian-American dishes on the menu — and some of them end up on po-boys. Take, for example, the Wayne Special: Veal parm and provolone with the house-made marinara on po-boy bread. A word to the wise: Get the Wayne Special toasted, but don’t get it dressed. Lettuce, tomato, and cold bread just aren’t that good on a hot veal parm po-boy. The gumbo and the onion rings are equally excellent.",
"Shhhhhh. This City Park-view restaurant’s weekday lunch drink deal isn’t written down anywhere but it’s a doozy. Simply ask the server for a 10 cent martini and say, ‘keep ‘em coming,’ while slurping up dark, rich turtle soup laced with sherry or New Orleans barbecue shrimp on a brown buttered baguette. Rather than a three-drink limit, Ralph’s flags anybody once they reach a $1.20 bar bill.  ",
"Ralph’s on the Park, situated in oak-tree rich Mid City, features several private dining rooms on the second floor of the restaurant, with seating from 10 to 200. The private dining areas include incredible, wrought-iron balconies overlooking City Park, perfect for pre-dinner cocktails and hors d’oeuvres.",
"The Rampart Food Store, aka the orange house at the corner of Kerlerec and N. Rampart, is renowned for its cheap, jumbo shrimp, fried to order po-boys. But the lighter than usual ya-ka-mein is worth the trip too, thanks to a frizzle of ramen noodles, thin curls of beef and fresh veggies like broccoli, carrots and cauliflower.",
"For those looking for an alternative to a poboy or perhaps a hangover cure, Evans recommends a stop in this Central City corner spot for a piping hot bowl of Red-Rooster’s “yet-ca-mein” or yakamein, New Orleans’ take on beef noodle and egg soup. For more yakamein spots, here’s a map.",
"Line up at the window at Red Rooster, just off Washington Avenue near the Magnolia Marketplace shopping center, and place an order for snowballs, po-boys and of course, ya-ka-mein, from 10:30 am-6:30 pm every day but Sunday. The soy-driven, salty broth studded with tender nibs of beef makes this ya-ka-mein just about perfect. ",
"Although there seems to be a revolving door in the kitchen, this feisty fusion of Creole and Sichuan delivers interesting, out of the box Chinese dishes. Kung pao pastrami, made with Louisiana’s holy trinity of onions, bell pepper and celery, and zesty smoked mushrooms and tofu are two to try. Fried chicken lovers will swoon over the General’s chicken, swabbed with bourbon, soy, peanuts and a dusting of cilantro.  ",
"A perfect divey stop while perusing tony Magazine Street, the Rendezvous is known for a massive beer program (24 revolving taps, 50-plus bottled beers) and enthusiastic crowds during Saints games. There are 11, count ‘em, 11, flat screens to watch the action. Happy hour two-for-ones are legend between 3 and 8 pm. ",
"This Besh Group stunner offers a superb Friday lunch experience, including a very reasonable $26 prix-fixe of three courses from chef Todd Pulsinelli— crispy flounder, Mississippi rabbit, seasonal appetizers— for those in search of something that's not quite as rowdy as Galatoire's.",
"Hearty options abound in a four course menu. A substantial first course features either fried chicken livers, a lump crabmeat salad, or chorizo-stuffed portobello mushroom followed. A trio of entree choices delves into deeply savory territory: prime rib, fried oysters, or bacon-wrapped pork tenderloin. $55 per person.",
"This Sicilian family-run Chalmette icon is about a 20 drive from downtown, but well worth the trip with a cafeteria style operation where huge portions of macaroni and cheese, red gravy, stuffed peppers, and perfectly fried soft shell crabs are doled out on the daily.",
"The sign may say Royal China, but all the locals call this place Miss Shirley’s, after host Shirley Lee, a Hong Kong native who has worked the dining room for decades. This Metairie fave is known for its dim sum, not offered on traditional carts, but made to order from the menu.  Pan fried shrimp dumplings, gelatinous chicken feet, curry squid are a few of dozens of choices offered on a menu that has pictures, which is a big help. Also, Royal China has a very popular lunch buffet.",
"Located in a quaint, converted shotgun cottage on busy Carrollton Avenue, this upscale Mid City eatery’s five-course Réveillon menu takes on bold, off-the-beaten path flavors. A second course features honey-glazed quail with coconut and cilantro, while a third course offers a Chinese-style pork belly with candied jalepeño and black vinegar. Diners can choose between puppy drum or fried lamb shank for entrees. $65 per person.",
"The holidays conjure images of all things sugar plum fairies — and there’s hardly a place better than Salon by Sucre to indulge in all things sugar. The restaurant, located in the French Quarter, is an outpost of the popular macaroon and sweets shop that started on Magazine Street. The private dining room has space for 25 seated and 30 in a reception format. Complete the look with a macaroon tree centerpiece.",
"While most po-boys are simply referred to by their ingredients, Sammy’s most popular sandwich has the distinction of being called by a proper name so endearing that it has to be said twice: the Ray Ray. Given Sammy’s location across from the Gentilly Lowe’s on Elysian Fields, it’s no coincidence that the Ray Ray is beloved among tradesmen and understandably so: Where else can one find fried chicken, ham, and cheese all packed into one loaf? Much of Sammy’s success stems from owner and former butcher Sammy Schloegel’s insistence on quality meat.  Choose 6” or 10” options with most larger sandwiches coming in at under $10; a large Ray Ray will set you back $12, fried seafood $12-15.",
"Before St. Claude Avenue became a happening entertainment scene, Saturn Bar was a thing. This quintessential Bywater dive always looks closed, but don’t let the ratty exterior scare you off. Inside you’ll find feisty bartenders, signed pictures of the Rolling Stones (they partied here back in the day), and — on one Saturday a month — a fab 60s dance party.",
"Shucks! in Abbeville, Louisiana is always packed and co-owner David Bertrand chats with diners like they’re old friends. To be honest, many of them are. Beyond the locals that flock here, duck hunters and other visitors come back year after year. The secret to the divine char-broiled oysters lies in the brief time the oysters spend cooking, keeping them plump and nearly raw beneath a lightly browned blanket of cheese and butter. Plus, it was a favorite haunt of Paul McIlhenny’s when he was heading out to his duck club.",
"The Thanksgiving offerings at Simone’s Market aren’t the traditional New Orleans Thanksgiving offerings, so there’s no oyster dressing or shrimp mirlitons to be found here. What the market and sandwich spot does have is sage and sausage cornbread dressing, green chili cornbread dressing, smoked gouda mac and cheese, pimiento cheese, pies from Windowsill Pies, and a cheesecake made with Mauthe’s creole cream cheese. Order by Friday, November 17, and pick it up November 21 or November 22. View the full menu here. ",
"While longtime owners Beau and Laura Nguyen serve up homemade Vietnemese-inspired pho and chicken wings every day of the week, the real draw of this well-maintained Black Pearl gem comes down to two essential words for Evans: Uptown Thursdays. “Thursdays Beau and Laura serve ‘off the menu’. That means five Korean pork tacos and either a can of Pale Ale or a shot of scotch for $5.” Unlike some corner spots, solid tables and a TV set-up mean patrons linger to chat. “Between bites, swap hiking stories with a Tulane student or mingle with Beau and Laura, the neighborhood’s most in-love husband and wife.” ",
"Calling Snake & Jake’s a dive bar is an upgrade -- this is basically a shack in a backyard lit up with year-round Christmas lights. There’s a cool outside space, dogs are welcome, and the bar opens late and shuts down in the early hours of the  morning so watching the sun rise is always an option. ",
"Fresh and clean-lined (and clean), Sobou provides a contemporary alternative to the Quarter’s vintage scene. Sobou features a small but considered wine menu, classic cocktails, in house originals, and local brews on draught. A very worthwhile 3-6 p.m. daily “happier” hour offers sazeracs, wine by the glass, and other drink specials as well as snacks, all for under $6. Bar generally closes about 11 p.m. ",
"This sly den of gastronomic sleight of hand in the W Hotel showcases chef Juan Carlos at his creative best. Munch the likes of cracklin’ crusted pork belly steam buns and cane-marinated mirliton while slurping down up to three vodka or gin martinis for just 25 cents each on weekdays between 11:30 a.m. and 3 p.m. Why just three? As the menu says “‘Cause that’s enough.”",
"Those looking for a decidedly different flavor profile may want to consider Sobou’s mid-range Puerto-Rican inspired Réveillon menu from Chef Juan Carlos Gonzalez. The four-course plus eggnog line-up includes plenty of bright winter citrus flavors paired with kumquat barbecue lamb steamed buns, crusted yellowfin tuna pinchos, and braised beef tongue tamales with black garlic crispy masa. $44 per person.",
"This Uptown cheese shop has dominated the casual lunch game since opening in 2007 with a menu of sandwiches featuring cheeses from Gruyere (with carmelized onions) to Rogue River's Smokey Blue (with thin sliced roast beef), not too mention a Ploughman's Lunch, meat boards and more.",
"Macaroon-obsessed Sucre has purple, green, and gold macaroons filled with a king cake-inspired mousseline. Order them individually or get 15 of them all wrapped up and tied with a bow in a Mardi Gras colored box. The 15-piece box is $37.50. ",
"The countdown to 2018 is also the countdown to the New Year’s Day Sugar Bowl in New Orleans, with Clemson and Alabama facing off in the Superdome. Owned by ‘Bama alum, The Rusty Nail has all that celebrating covered with a two-day Sugar Bowl extravaganza starting on New Year’s Eve. McClure’s Barbecue will be serving all day and night. At 11 a.m., the Nail opens for NFL football. By 3 p.m., the bar turns into Tuscaloosa South with the fight song and other ‘Bama favorites played every hour. Get your yacht rock on at 9 p.m. with Where Y’acht performing. At midnight, toast with a complimentary glass of Champagne while listening to Auld Lang Syne followed by — you guessed it — the Fight Song. More info here. ",
"No frills Suire’s brings Cajun comfort food to the table. A favorite among the region’s duck hunters, it’s a hospitable restaurant run by sisters who have been working there since they were teenagers. It’s known for a long-simmered turtle sauce piquant, but be sure to save some space for pecan pie and sweet tarts.",
"With many exciting and modern Vietnamese restaurants opened by the children of the Vietnamese immigrants who came to New Orleans in the 1970s, this traditional Vietnamese Westbank favorite is still well worth the trip. Often filled with generations of Vietnamese families, the large restaurant takes strip shopping center dining to an unheard of level with frog legs tossed in garlic butter, roasted quail, and warming pho in both meat and vegetarian varieties. Also of note, the children from the Tan Dinh family run the edgier Ba Chi Canteen on Maple Street in metro New Orleans. ",
"On any given day, the crown jewels of Tastee donuts are the buttermilk drops. Not gonna lie — lots of justly people go here to relive McKenzie’s (RIP) king cake, but the buttermilk drop version is also super-addictive (and also a McKenzie’s recipe). It’s basically a ring of those little dreams topped with icing and Mardi Gras colored sugar. What could possibly go wrong with that?",
"Ted's Frostop is an Uptown institution, serving old school diner faves like burgers, malts, all-you-can-eat pancakes, and of course hot dogs. Have one with a root beer float and you can practically feel yourself time warp to the 50s. Open 7 days a week.",
"Just steps off Bourbon Street, this popular spot for late-night food offers 150 brands of beer and one of the best burgers in town. It draws a crowd of service industry regulars and tourists all about cheap eats and drinks, and generous pours. The scene is no-frills dive, the food is just fine and there when you need it most. Whatever that time might be.",
"A reliable spot for good food on Bourbon Street, this burger and sports joint has quite a few good dogs to choose from. Choose from basic dogs to brats; or go wild with the Zydeco dog, a savory beignet battered and fried hot dog with cheese sauce, slaw, beer grain mustard, spicy ketchup. The large menu here means something for everyone. Be warned: This is a sports-watching Mecca, so there are TV’s everywhere (which can be good or extremely annoying, depending on what you are looking for).",
"Located at the edge of the Quarter on Rampart St, relative newcomer The Black Penny bills itself as a neighborhood bar. And while the beer-centric, dog-friendly spot draws a diverse crowd, patrons tend to skew slightly hipster. Dark, woody, and more introspective than its cocktail-oriented older sister Bar Tonique, the Penny is a prime spot to sit at the wrap-around bar and sample off-the-beaten-path ales. An extensive beer menu divided into taste profiles helps to guide the palette and the pocket book. Full bar available; no kitchen but most evenings, a changing line up of moderately-priced eats can be ordered from the grill flanking the front door.",
"While known mostly for its martini menu, Southern flavors seep into the venerated walls of this ye olde English gentleman’s club-like French Quarter stronghold. A four-course menu includes some serious stick-to-your-rib options such as rabbit and tasso gumbo with potato salad, pecan and andouille crusted redfish with oyster and artichoke stew and a dessert option which, depending upon how you look at it, either signals the end of all ambition or its apex: eggnog spiked espresso cake with chocolate streusel. $49 per person.",
"This venerable institution received a thoughtful, well-deserved renovation in 2016. The cozy Bayou Bar downstairs retains its original Louisiana landscape murals painted by Charles Reinike; drinking a classic cocktail here makes one feels as if time stopped at 1950. The Hot Tin rooftop bar is an airy living room that opens onto a balcony with a 270 degree view of the city that can’t be beat.",
"Arnaud’s is home to a dizzying maze of private dining rooms, each with its own personality — and probably its own ghosts. The quintessential New Orleans experience can be found in the Bourbon Suites, which come with a lobby; private, built-in bar; and a balcony overlooking Bourbon for all the bead-throwing needs. Each adjoining suite seats 20 people. One of the most festive times to visit is when the  restaurant gets decked out for the holidays. Be sure to visit the restaurant’s own private Mardi Gras Museum, and grab a drink at the award-winning French 75 Bar. Plus, 2018 marks this restaurant’s 100th year, which is a reason in itself to celebrate in style. ",
"With over 100 different beers, wings, outdoor seating, and lots of televisions, there’s not much more you could ask for on Super Bowl Sunday. Plus, there’s an outdoor patio with screens to watch the game should there be nice weather. ",
"The Carousel has been a cherished local landmark for65 years, and it’s not unusual to find locals whose parents and even grandparents, frequented this delightful spot in the  Hotel Monteleone. Yes, the bar is lit up and shaped like a carousel (fortunately stools mean there’s no need to straddle an animal) and yes, it does turn though at one revolution every fifteen minutes, you might not notice. Consider splurging on a slow sipping cocktail like a sazerac or the house special, a Vieux Carre. In addition to the bar, arrangements of posh club chairs in the spacious lounge accommodate groups, and should appease even the snootiest of relatives and friends. Some live music afternoons and evenings.",
"Locals sometimes forget this is a hotel since we are so used to treating it as only a bar. While the interior’s jewel-toned Victorian vibe transports guests to late 19th century New Orleans (it’s no accident Pretty Baby was filmed there), it’s the front porch, with its views of Live Oaks and passing streetcars, that gets my vote as one of the best drinking spots in the city for an Old Fashioned. New Orleanians may still be wearing shorts come December, but should the temperature drop, drinkers can head inside for a warm Irish coffee or nice pour of Scotch and take a seat at either the classic bar or in one of the cozy booths.",
"Company Burger is known for its get-down-to-business burger, but it also has quite a few “not burgers,” like its Company hot dog. The dog game proves to be as serious as the burger game with a focus on just a few quality products shining on their own. A Nueske's beef and pork smoked link with onion and relish can be yours for $7.50 (and special hot dogs appearing on the menu occasionally). Be sure to get a side of the onion rings and a watermelon Pimm’s Cup. ",
"Located in recently renovated elegant cottage, The Country Club has long been a key Bywater social fixture. Five courses divided evenly between the sea and land with crab and caviar and redfish courses as well as black truffle roasted poussin and oxtail ragu, both with hearty and savory sides, followed by the love child of two classic desserts: Baked Alaska Jubilee. $60 per person.",
"The Friendly Bar, set on the corner of a gorgeous street in the Marigny, lives up to its name with welcoming bartenders, an always lively crowd of local neighbors, and — on most Wednesdays — there’s meat night. Yes, as in meat, not meet. Bring your own protein and fling it on the grill that’s set up out front, with potluck sides served in the bar and a tip jar to say thanks. ",
"A dozen dozen (that’s 144) roses stand at the entrance to the elegant Windsor Court Hotel every single day, as if to say, “We don’t do anything halfway.” In recent years, the Windsor Court’s food team has put in overtime building menus that put it on the map of places to go eat, whether you’re staying at the hotel or not. Though dinner boasts an excellent choose-your-own-adventure style “tasting menu” with dishes like a divine lobster Newburg, lunch is predictably no slouch. A power lunch with the approachable sensibility of the “meat and three” plate lunch (with “meats” like crab cakes and “sides” like crawfish pasta) and at only $19.84 (the hotel opened in 1984) with the option of $2 martinis, it’s also a bargain. Of note: Limit three martinis. It’s a three martini lunch, remember? Also, the martinis are made with Plymouth or Tito’s and olives and onions marinated at the hotel.",
"This elegant dining room in the Windsor Court serves up a four-course menu with wide-ranging tastes including a mushroom fricassee with truffled puree potatoes and caviar, ginger anise beef short ribs, or red snapper with crawfish and corn ragout. Finish on an indulgent note with a chocolate and orange brandy crepe with Creole cream cheese custard. $54 per person.",
"There are gold toilet “seats” at The John, a 24/7 watering hole that is dark, cavernous, and blessedly cool in the summer. Close to Frenchmen Street, there’s a ping pong table, old school video games, a good juke box, and oh yeah, that toilet theme is the best. ",
"There’s dining, and then there’s Donald Link and Stephen Stryjewski dining, which can involve lots of meat and southern sides at Cochon. Why not tuck your napkin in your shirt and put your elbows on the table out of view of others, or sort of out of view of others? The new semi-private mezzanine in the Diamond Street dining room at Cochon seats up to 40. ",
"Travel and Leisure ranked The Old No. 77 number 13 on its list of continental U.S. city hotels. One big reason is its stellar restaurant, Compere Lapin, whose bar program is overseen by Abigail Gullo, Heaven Hill 2016 Bartender of the Year. Located in a former warehouse, Old No. 77’s original brick walls serve as a vintage background where Gullo’s team serves up fresh takes on old favorites. The combination of amazing food, carefully crafted drinks and a friendly staff make this a top spot for those seeking inventive imbibing.",
"The best thing about the Super Bowl is that it falls during crawfish season, and the Rusty Nail gets this. For the third year running, the Warehouse District bar is throwing a “Super Boil” party with boiled crawfish, McClure’s barbecue, drinks, and the Super Bowl. The first 50 crawfish customers can keep their their Abita-branded crawfish tray. The party starts at 1 p.m. ",
"An awesome dive in the LGD with fantastic bartenders, a full bar, daiquiris, a photo booth and a free jukebox on Sundays.",
"Rumor has it that Governor Huey Long built a state highway from Baton Rouge to New Orleans just so he could get to his favorite bar, the Sazerac, in under an hour. While that story may not hold up to scrutiny, what is certain is that the “Kingfish” flew the Sazerac’s head bartender to New York to instruct northerners in the proper way to make a Ramos Gin Fizz. If Long’s stamp of approval isn’t enough reason to visit, Paul Ninas’ WPA-era murals depicting New Orleans, golden wood-panelled walls and the equally crafted drinks make the Sazerac a must-see. It’s located inside the Roosevelt Hotel, and — come December — the ornate, gilded lobby becomes a wonderland of white lights.",
"Tchoup Yard is part beach bar and part beer garden. It’s got plenty of outdoor seating, frozen drinks, and 13 big screen televisions. Plus, there’s a new indoor expansion with Karibu Kitchen. ",
"The first floor with its large, marble oyster bar,  and the second floor with a smaller cocktail bar are familiar territory to Seaworthy guests. Follow those curved staircases up past more candles held firm with dripped wax to the third floor, which houses the restaurant’s private dining room. It’s an intimate room fit for a ship’s captain with seating for 20.",
"The private dining room at Commander’s Palace is as exclusive as it gets. Walk past  the masses through an iron gate and down a hallway to the restaurant’s famous wine cellar, which has a table set up for dining. Expect a menu designed for the occasion for 10-14 guests, plus wine pairings. Word to the wise: Bring a sweater; wine cellars are cold. ",
"This hole-in-the-wall laundromat/bar is known for cheap, cold brews and regular crawfish boils. It’s located close to Bourbon Street. It’s friendly for leashed pooches. And it’s open 24 hours. What more could you possibly need?",
"While most Reveillon menus tend to play off Creole and Cajun flavors, it’s Italian fare that rules Tommy’s moderately priced, four-course Réveillon meal. Features include a pasta course with either pasta bolognese or butternut squash gemelli, and either pan-roasted gulf fish or pork chop Milanese for the entree. Chocophile alert: truffle mousse with creme anglaise and toasted almonds. $45 per person",
"If meat is what you're after, head to this casual Cajun eatery in Mid City from chef Isaac Toups, where the chef's lunch (boudin, burger and a beer) will set you back about $22 but the house signatures, like barbecue goat and the double cut pork chop with dirty rice, are not to be overlooked.",
"A crab cala kickstarts this Réveillon meal followed by three courses. Diners can choose between two entree options, either speckled trout or paneed veal. Savory and sweet and naughty get all rolled into one in the form of a cinnamon bread pudding with Wild Turkey ice cream. Located within the Southern Food and Beverage Museum on revitalized O.C. Haley Boulevard. $55 per person.",
"Come hungry on Super Bowl Sunday. This friendly Irish Channel bar is both a sports bar destination and a po-boy destination (try the roast beef po-boy). If the weather is nice, the bar’s French doors will be open to Magazine Street. They love football here, and they want to share that love with their customers.",
"Trey Yuen is a bright spot on the local Chinese food horizon, although you need to travel across the 24-mile causeway to the other side of the lake to find it. (Lots to do over there, so plan to make a day of it.) In the hands of the third generation of Wongs, who opened their first eatery in Hammond in 1971, this restaurant is full of Chinese art and artifacts and includes a pretty koi pond (ask about fish food for the kids). Prices are a notch up, but the upgrade in quality ingredients and presentation is well worth it. A few dishes to try: the ethereal shrimp and crab in a cloud, rich with egg and flavors of the sea; a bracing crawfish in spicy black bean sauce; and for the intrepid, alligator and fresh mushrooms. ",
"Located  in the Lower Garden District just steps from the St. Charles Avenue streetcar line, Trolley Stop is ideal for a gang of pals out on the town plagued by conflicting cravings. Eggs, bacon and grits? Red beans and rice? Bacon cheeseburger? Bread pudding? Check, check, check, and check at this 24/7 comfort food emporium that serves decent breakfast, lunch, and dinner any time of day.  ",
"This new sandwich spot in the LGD from former Coquette cook Mason Hereford is the best new lunch destination New Orleans has seen in quite a while. Wacky but incredible eats like a huge chicken fried steak sandwich and hilarious but tasty headcheese 'tacos inauthenticos' make this a great new stop for locals and tourists alike.",
"Open 24 hours Thursday through Saturday (until 3 am the rest of the week), Turtle Bay is well known for its $16.95, 20-ounce rib eye served with potato skins and garlic bread, big enough for two to share. Thin crust pizza is the cheesiest, hot wings are good, there is boiled crawfish when it’s in season, and the bartender pours a strong drink.  What’s not to like? ",
"Vaughan’s is a joy, guaranteed to deliver cheap drinks, good music, and the kind of conviviality that you hope for when stumbling into a dive bar. Corey Henry and the Treme Funktet play here every Thursday, offering an additional incentive to ditch typical Valentine’s Day plans this year. If you’re lucky there will be a pot of delicious red beans and rice in the back, which customers are welcome to scoop a bowl of for free. ",
"No list would be complete without it. In a neighborhood geared towards high-end table service, Verti Marte offers a welcome, budget-friendly respite. The oyster and shrimp and dripping “all that jazz” poboys have been saving incalculable numbers of the late night hordes from the mother of all hangovers for years. A wide ranging menu includes the usual suspects but also breakfast and Italian-inspired pasta. ",
"This cash-only, round-the-clock deli and convenience store really does have something for everybody. The menu goes on and on, beyond po-boys to grilled chicken salad and a handful of vegetarian items. Then there’s the meat and two sides, comfort fare including Grandma’s boarding house meatloaf and shrimp Creole, all well under $10. One can get breakfast whenever, best enjoyed standing at one of the tall tables that are sometimes by the door or on the stoop across the street, where stray picnickers always congregate. ",
"Free is good. That’s the deal at this popular Louisiana-Italian eatery Uptown on the St. Charles Avenue street car line, one free martini with a lunch entree. The 80-year old locals’ hang-out is small and dark with a slight air of mafioso. Comfortable, burgundy leather chairs and a long, dark wood bar make it a perfect spot to dine on the veal Roberto and wash it down with ice cold vodka. ",
"Don’t come looking for fried shrimp here at this New Orleans East po-boy hotspot. At Walker’s it’s all about barbecue: pork, brisket, and smoked chicken. Praised by the likes of Anthony Bourdain and Esquire, Walker’s is most known for its uber tender cochon de lait po-boy, a perennial favorite at Jazzfest, or try the other house specialty, Burnt Ends, made from brisket tips. Sandwiches run $8-12. Indoor seating available. Want carry out? Call ahead. Note: Doors close when the meat is gone, so best to come well before 6 pm. Closed Sunday and Monday.",
"Pies probably come to mind when you consider ordering Willa Jean for this Thanksgiving’s gastronomic needs (as they should), but the bakery and cafe also has a few savory options, bread, and even a salad to take for your own Thanksgiving table: pimiento mac and cheese, cornbread and andouille stuffing, baguettes, and more. The deadline to order is Thursday, November 19 at 7 p.m. Pick up the day before Thanksgiving, or on Thanksgiving from 7 a.m. until noon. Find the full menu here. ",
"Show up. Wait in line. They'll tell you when a table is ready, and when it is, you'll eat some of the best fried chicken in existence. Don't overlook those peas either.",
"For nearly 80 years, Zara’s has been the beloved little engine that could: an affordable and well-considered grocery that manages to successfully cater to both its upscale Prytania St. neighborhood but without the upscale, Uptown price tag. Order at the deli counter and take your po-boy to go or park yourself at one of the tables out front."]
